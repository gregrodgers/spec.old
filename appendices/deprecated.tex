% This is deprecated.tex (Appendix E) of the OpenMP specification.
% This is an included file. See the master file for more information.
%
% When editing this file:
%
%    1. To change formatting, appearance, or style, please edit openmp.sty.
%
%    2. Custom commands and macros are defined in openmp.sty.
%
%    3. Be kind to other editors -- keep a consistent style by copying-and-pasting to
%       create new content.
%
%    4. We use semantic markup, e.g. (see openmp.sty for a full list):
%         \code{}     % for bold monospace keywords, code, operators, etc.
%         \plc{}      % for italic placeholder names, grammar, etc.
%
%    5. There are environments that provide special formatting, e.g. language bars.
%       Please use them whereever appropriate.  Examples are:
%
%         \begin{fortranspecific}
%         This is text that appears enclosed in blue language bars for Fortran.
%         \end{fortranspecific}
%
%         \begin{note}
%         This is a note.  The "Note -- " header appears automatically.
%         \end{note}
%
%    6. Other recommendations:
%         Use the convenience macros defined in openmp.sty for the minor headers
%         such as Comments, Syntax, etc.
%
%         To keep items together on the same page, prefer the use of 
%         \begin{samepage}.... Avoid \parbox for text blocks as it interrupts line numbering.
%         When possible, avoid \filbreak, \pagebreak, \newpage, \clearpage unless that's
%         what you mean. Use \needspace{} cautiously for troublesome paragraphs.
%
%         Avoid absolute lengths and measures in this file; use relative units when possible.
%         Vertical space can be relative to \baselineskip or ex units. Horizontal space
%         can be relative to \linewidth or em units.
%
%         Prefer \emph{} to italicize terminology, e.g.:
%             This is a \emph{definition}, not a placeholder.
%             This is a \plc{var-name}.
