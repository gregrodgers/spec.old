      \specref{subsec:omp_get_affinity_format},
      \specref{subsec:omp_display_affinity}, and
      \specref{subsec:omp_capture_affinity}) and environment variables
      (see \specref{sec:OMP_DISPLAY_AFFINITY} and

      (see \specref{subsec:omp_get_device_num}) was added to support
      determination of the device on which a thread is executing.

\item The \code{omp_pause_resource} and \code{omp_pause_resource_all} 
      runtime routines were added to allow the runtime to relinquish 
      resources used by OpenMP (see \specref{subsec:omp_pause_resource}

\item Interface Declarations (previously Appendix B) were moved to a separate document.

\end{itemize}


\section{Version 4.0 to 4.5 Differences}
\label{sec:Version 4.0 to 4.5 Differences}

      and \code{target}~\code{simd}
      (see \specref{subsec:target simd Construct}),
      combined constructs were added.

      \plc{directive-name-modifier} that allows it to apply
      to combined constructs (see \specref{sec:if Clause}).

\item The \code{hint} clause was addded to the \code{critical} construct
      (see \specref{subsec:critical Construct}).

      \code{target} regions was changed to \code{firstprivate} (see
      \specref{subsubsec:Data-sharing Attribute Rules for Variables
      Referenced in a Construct}).

\item Use of some C++ reference types was allowed in some data sharing
      attribute clauses (see \specref{subsec:Data-Sharing Attribute Clauses}).

      with a lock to select a desired lock implementation for a lock's
      intended usage by the application code (see
      \specref{subsec:omp_init_lock_with_hint and omp_init_nest_lock_with_hint}).

\item Device memory routines were added to allow explicit allocation,
      deallocation, memory transfers and memory associations (see

atomic swap with the \code{capture} clause, to allow new atomic update and capture
forms, and to support sequentially consistent atomic operations with a new \code{seq_cst}
clause.

\section{Version 3.0 to 3.1 Differences}
\label{sec:Version 3.0 to 3.1 Differences}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \plc{bind-var} ICV has been added, which controls whether or not threads are bound

\specref{subsec:ICV Descriptions}).
The value of this ICV can be set with
the \code{OMP_PROC_BIND} environment variable (see
\specref{sec:OMP_PROC_BIND}).

\item The \code{final} and \code{mergeable} clauses (see

\item The \code{atomic} construct (see
\specref{subsec:atomic Construct}) was extended to include
\code{read}, \code{write}, and \code{capture} forms, and an \code{update} clause was added to apply
the already existing form of the \code{atomic} construct.

\item Data environment restrictions were changed to allow \code{intent(in)} and

\specref{sec:Nesting of Regions} were clarified to disallow
closely-nested OpenMP regions within an \code{atomic} region. This allows an \code{atomic}
region to be consistently defined with other OpenMP regions so that they include all
code in the atomic construct.

\item The \code{omp_in_final} runtime library routine (see
\specref{subsec:omp_in_final}) was
added to support specialization of final task regions.

\item The \plc{nthreads-var} ICV has been modified to be a list of the number of threads to use
at each nested parallel region level. The value of this ICV is still set with the
\code{OMP_NUM_THREADS} environment variable (see
\specref{sec:OMP_NUM_THREADS}), but the
algorithm for determining the number of threads used in a parallel region has been
modified to handle a list (see
\specref{subsec:Determining the Number of Threads for a parallel Region}).

\item Descriptions of examples (previously Appendix A) were expanded and
clarified.

\item Replaced incorrect use of \code{omp_integer_kind} in Fortran interfaces with
\code{selected_int_kind(8)}.

\section{Version 2.5 to 3.0 Differences}
\label{sec:Version 2.5 to 3.0 Differences}

\begin{itemize}
\item The definition of active \code{parallel} region has been changed: in Version 3.0 a
\code{parallel} region is active if it is executed by a team consisting of more than one
thread (see
\specref{subsec:OpenMP Language Terminology}).

\item The concept of tasks has been added to the OpenMP execution model (see
\specref{subsec:Tasking Terminology} and
\specref{sec:Execution Model}).

\item The OpenMP memory model now covers atomicity of memory accesses (see
\specref{subsec:Structure of the OpenMP Memory Model}).
The description of the behavior of \code{volatile} in terms of
\code{flush} was removed.

\item In Version 2.5, there was a single copy of the \plc{nest-var}, \plc{dyn-var}, \plc{nthreads-var} and
\plc{run-sched-var} internal control variables (ICVs) for the whole program. In Version
3.0, there is one copy of these ICVs per task (see
\specref{sec:Internal Control Variables}). As a result,
the \code{omp_set_num_threads}, \code{omp_set_nested} and \code{omp_set_dynamic}
runtime library routines now have specified effects when called from inside a
\code{parallel} region (see
\specref{subsec:omp_set_num_threads},
\specref{subsec:omp_set_dynamic} and
\specref{subsec:omp_set_nested}).

\item The \plc{thread-limit-var} ICV has been added, which controls the maximum number of
threads participating in the OpenMP program. The value of this ICV can be set with
the \code{OMP_THREAD_LIMIT} environment variable and retrieved with the
\code{omp_get_thread_limit} runtime library routine (see
\specref{subsec:ICV Descriptions},
\specref{subsec:omp_get_thread_limit} and
\specref{sec:OMP_THREAD_LIMIT}).

\item The \plc{max-active-levels-var} ICV has been added, which controls the number of nested
active \code{parallel} regions. The value of this ICV can be set with the
\code{OMP_MAX_ACTIVE_LEVELS} environment variable and the
\code{omp_set_max_active_levels} runtime library routine, and it can be retrieved
with the \code{omp_get_max_active_levels} runtime library routine (see
\specref{subsec:ICV Descriptions},
\specref{subsec:omp_set_max_active_levels},
\specref{subsec:omp_get_max_active_levels} and
\specref{sec:OMP_MAX_ACTIVE_LEVELS}).

\item The \plc{stacksize-var} ICV has been added, which controls the stack size for threads that
the OpenMP implementation creates. The value of this ICV can be set with the
\code{OMP_STACKSIZE} environment variable (see
\specref{subsec:ICV Descriptions} and
\specref{sec:OMP_STACKSIZE}).

\item The \plc{wait-policy-var} ICV has been added, which controls the desired behavior of
waiting threads. The value of this ICV can be set with the \code{OMP_WAIT_POLICY}
environment variable (see
\specref{subsec:ICV Descriptions} and
\specref{sec:OMP_WAIT_POLICY}).

\item The rules for determining the number of threads used in a \code{parallel} region have
been modified (see
\specref{subsec:Determining the Number of Threads for a parallel Region}).

\item In Version 3.0, the assignment of iterations to threads in a loop construct with a
\code{static} schedule kind is deterministic (see
\specref{subsec:Worksharing-Loop Construct}).

\item In Version 3.0, a loop construct may be associated with more than one perfectly
nested loop. The number of associated loops may be controlled by the \code{collapse}
clause (see
\specref{subsec:Worksharing-Loop Construct}).

\item Random access iterators, and variables of unsigned integer type, may now be used as
loop iterators in loops associated with a loop construct (see
\specref{subsec:Worksharing-Loop Construct}).

\item The schedule kind \code{auto} has been added, which gives the implementation the
freedom to choose any possible mapping of iterations in a loop construct to threads in
the team (see \specref{subsec:Worksharing-Loop Construct}).

\item The \code{task} construct (see \specref{sec:Tasking Constructs}) has been
      added, which provides a mechanism for creating tasks explicitly.

\item The \code{taskwait} construct (see
\specref{subsec:taskwait Construct}) has been added, which
causes a task to wait for all its child tasks to complete.

\item Fortran assumed-size arrays now have predetermined data-sharing attributes (see
\specref{subsubsec:Data-sharing Attribute Rules for Variables Referenced in a Construct}).

\item In Version 3.0, static class members variables may appear in a \code{threadprivate}
directive (see
\specref{subsec:threadprivate Directive}).

\item Version 3.0 makes clear where, and with which arguments, constructors and
destructors of private and threadprivate class type variables are called (see
\specref{subsec:threadprivate Directive},
\specref{subsubsec:private clause},
\specref{subsubsec:firstprivate clause},
\specref{subsubsec:copyin clause} and
\specref{subsubsec:copyprivate clause}).

\item In Version 3.0, Fortran allocatable arrays may appear in \code{private},
\code{firstprivate}, \code{lastprivate}, \code{reduction}, \code{copyin} and \code{copyprivate}
clauses (see
\specref{subsec:threadprivate Directive},
\specref{subsubsec:private clause},
\specref{subsubsec:firstprivate clause},
\specref{subsubsec:lastprivate clause},
\specref{subsubsec:reduction clause},
\specref{subsubsec:copyin clause} and
\specref{subsubsec:copyprivate clause}).

\item In Fortran, \code{firstprivate} is now permitted as an argument to the \code{default}
clause (see
\specref{subsubsec:default clause}).

\item For list items in the \code{private} clause, implementations are no longer permitted to use
the storage of the original list item to hold the new list item on the master thread. If
no attempt is made to reference the original list item inside the \code{parallel} region, its
value is well defined on exit from the \code{parallel} region (see
\specref{subsubsec:private clause}).

\item The runtime library routines \code{omp_set_schedule} and \code{omp_get_schedule}
have been added; these routines respectively set and retrieve the value of the
\plc{run-sched-var} ICV (see\\
\specref{subsec:omp_set_schedule} and
\specref{subsec:omp_get_schedule}).

\item The \code{omp_get_level} runtime library routine has been added, which returns the
number of nested \code{parallel} regions enclosing the task that contains the call (see
\specref{subsec:omp_get_level}).

\item The \code{omp_get_ancestor_thread_num} runtime library routine has been added,
which returns, for a given nested level of the current thread, the thread number of the
ancestor (see
\specref{subsec:omp_get_ancestor_thread_num}).

\item The \code{omp_get_team_size} runtime library routine has been added, which returns,
for a given nested level of the current thread, the size of the thread team to which the
ancestor belongs (see
\specref{subsec:omp_get_team_size}).

\item The \code{omp_get_active_level} runtime library routine has been added, which
returns the number of nested, active \code{parallel} regions enclosing the task that
contains the call (see\linebreak \specref{subsec:omp_get_active_level}).

\item In Version 3.0, locks are owned by tasks, not by threads (see
\specref{sec:Lock Routines}).
\end{itemize}
