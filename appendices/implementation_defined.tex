\chapter{OpenMP Implementation-Defined Behaviors}
\label{chap:OpenMP Implementation-Defined Behaviors}
\index{implementation}
This appendix summarizes the behaviors that are described as implementation defined in
this API. Each behavior is cross-referenced back to its description in the main
specification. An implementation is required to define and document its behavior in
these cases.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Processor}: a hardware unit that is implementation defined (see
\specref{subsec:Threading Concepts}).

\item \textbf{Device}: an implementation defined logical execution engine (see
\specref{subsec:Threading Concepts}).

\item \textbf{Device address}: reference to an address in a \emph{device data environment} (see \specref{subsec:Data Terminology}).

\item \textbf{Memory model}: the minimum size at which a memory update may also read and
write back adjacent variables that are part of another variable (as array or structure
elements) is implementation defined but is no larger than required by the base
language (see \specref{subsec:Structure of the OpenMP Memory Model}).

\item \code{requires} \textbf{directive}: support of requirements is implementation defined. All implementation-defined requirements should begin with \code{ext_} (see \specref{sec:requires Directive}).

\item \textbf{Requires directive}: Support for any feature specified by a
requirement clause on a \code{requires} directive is implementation
defined (see \specref{sec:requires Directive}).

\index{internal control variables}
\item \textbf{Internal control variables}: the initial values of
\plc{dyn-var}, \plc{nest-var}, \plc{nthreads-var}, \plc{run-sched-var},
\plc{def-sched-var}, \plc{bind-var}, \plc{stacksize-var},
\plc{wait-policy-var}, \plc{thread-limit-var},
\plc{max-active-levels-var}, \plc{place-partition-var}, \plc{affinity-format-var},
\plc{default-device-var} and \plc{def-allocator-var} are implementation defined.  The method for
initializing a target device's internal control variable is
implementation defined (see \specref{subsec:ICV Initialization}).

\item \textbf{OpenMP context}: the accepted \plc{isa-name} values for
  the \plc{isa} trait, the accepted \plc{arch-name} values for the
  \plc{arch} trait, and the accepted \plc{extension-name} values for
  the \plc{extension} trait are implementation defined (see
  \specref{subsec:OpenMP Context}).

\item \code{declare}~\code{variant} \textbf{directive}: whether, for some specific
  OpenMP context, the prototype of the variant should differ from that of
  the base function, and if so how it should differ, is implementation defined
  (see \specref{subsec:declare variant Directive}).

\index{dynamic thread adjustment}
\item \textbf{Dynamic adjustment of threads}: providing the ability to dynamically adjust the
number of threads is implementation defined. Implementations are allowed to deliver
fewer threads (but at least one) than indicated in Algorithm 2.1 even if dynamic
adjustment is disabled (see \specref{subsec:Determining the Number of Threads for a parallel Region}).

\item \textbf{Thread affinity}: For the \code{close} thread affinity
  policy, if $T > P$ and $P$ does not divide $T$ evenly, the exact
  number of threads in a particular place is implementation defined.
  For the \code{spread} thread affinity, if $T > P$ and $P$ does not
  divide $T$ evenly, the exact number of threads in a particular
  subpartition is implementation defined.  The determination of
  whether the affinity request can be fulfilled is implementation
  defined.  If not, the mapping of threads in the team 
  to places is implementation defined (see
  \specref{subsec:Controlling OpenMP Thread Affinity}).

\item \code{teams} \textbf{construct}: the number of teams that are created is implementation defined but
less than or equal to the value of the \code{num_teams} clause if specified. The maximum
number of threads participating in the contention group that each team initiates is
implementation defined but less than or equal to the value of the \code{thread_limit}
clause if specified.  The assignment of the initial threads to places and

is implementation defined (see \specref{subsec:single Construct})

implementation defined (see \specref{subsec:Worksharing-Loop
  Construct}).

\item \code{simd} \textbf{construct}: the integer type (or kind, for
  Fortran) used to compute the iteration count for the collapsed loop
  is implementation defined. The number of iterations that are
  executed concurrently at any given time is implementation
  defined. If the \plc{alignment} parameter is not specified in the
  \code{aligned} clause, the default alignments for the SIMD
  instructions are implementation defined (see \specref{subsubsec:simd Construct}).

\item \code{declare simd} \textbf{directive}: if the parameter of the
  \code{simdlen} clause is not a constant positive integer expression,
  the number of concurrent arguments for the function is
  implementation defined. If the \plc{alignment} parameter of the
  \code{aligned} clause is not specified, the default alignments for
  SIMD instructions are implementation defined (see
  \specref{subsubsec:declare simd Directive}).

\item \code{distribute} \textbf{construct}: the integer type (or kind, for
    Fortran) used to compute the iteration count for the collapsed loop is
    implementation defined.  If no \code{dist_schedule} clause is specified then the schedule for the \code{distribute}
construct is implementation defined (see \specref{subsec:distribute Construct}).

\item \code{taskloop} \textbf{construct}: The number of loop
  iterations assigned to a task created from a \code{taskloop}
  construct is implementation defined, unless the \code{grainsize} or
  \code{num_tasks} clause is specified. The integer type (or kind,
  for Fortran) used to compute the iteration count for the collapsed
  loop is implementation defined (see \specref{subsec:taskloop Construct}).

\begin{cppspecific}
\item \code{taskloop} \textbf{construct}: For \code{firstprivate} variables of class type, the number of invocations of copy constructors to perform the initialization is implementation defined

The associated memory space for each of the predefined \code{omp_cgroup_mem_alloc}, \code{omp_pteam_mem_alloc} and \code{omp_thread_mem_alloc} allocators is implementation defined (see  \tabref{tab:Predefined Allocators}).

\index{atomic construct@{\code{atomic} construct}}
between \code{atomic} regions that update different storage locations. The circumstances
under which this occurs are implementation defined. If the storage location
designated by $x$ is not size-aligned (that is, if the byte alignment of $x$ is not a multiple
of the size of $x$), then the behavior of the atomic region is implementation defined (see \specref{subsec:atomic Construct}).
