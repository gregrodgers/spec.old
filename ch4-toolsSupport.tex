\chapter{Tools Support}
\index{Tools Support}
\label{chap:ToolsSupport}

This chapter describes the OpenMP API specific to interact with third-party tools.
The chapter covers how an OpenMP runtime uses the value of the \plc{omp-tool-var} ICV to decide whether or not an OpenMP runtime will try to register a tool prior to runtime initialization.
Follows an explanation on how a registered tool initializes itself.

\section{Tool Registration}
\index{tool registration}
\label{sec:ToolsSupport_Registration}

The \code{OMP\_TOOL} environment variable sets the \plc{omp-tool-var} ICV, which controls whether or not an OpenMP runtime will try to register a tool.
The value assigned to \code{OMP\_TOOL} is case insensitive and may have leading and trailing white space.
The value of this environment variable must be \code{enabled} or \code{disabled}.
If \code{OMP\_TOOL} is set to any value other than \code{enabled} or \code{disabled}, an OpenMP runtime will print a fatal error to the standard error file descriptor indicating that an illegal value had been supplied for \code{OMP\_TOOL} and the program's execution will terminate.
If \code{OMP\_TOOL} is not defined, the default value for \plc{omp-tool-var} is \code{enabled}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|p{4.5in}|}
\hline
 {\em omp-tool-var} value & action \\\hline
enabled & the OpenMP runtime will call \code{ompt\_tool} before initializing itself.\\\hline
disabled & the OpenMP runtime will not call \code{ompt\_tool}, regardless of whether a tool is present or not.\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{OpenMP runtime responses to settings of the {\em omp-tool-var} ICV.}
\label{table:ToolsSupport_env-var}
\end{table}

\sloppy
Table~\ref{table:ToolsSupport_env-var} describes the action that an OpenMP runtime will take in response to possible values of \plc{omp-tool-var}.
If the value of \plc{omp-tool-var} is \code{enabled}, the runtime will attempt to register a tool by calling the function \code{ompt\_tool} before performing runtime initialization.
The signature for \code{ompt\_tool} is shown below:
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
extern "C" {
  ompt_initialize_fn_t ompt_tool(void);
};
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
If a tool provides an implementation of \code{ompt\_tool} in the application's address space, it may return \code{NULL} indicating that the tool declines to register itself with the runtime; otherwise, the tool may register itself with the runtime by returning a non-\code{NULL} pointer to a function with type signature \code{ompt\_initialize\_fn\_t}.
The type signature for \code{ompt\_initialize\_fn\_t} is described in Section~\ref{sec:ToolsSupport_init}. 
Since only one tool-provided definition of \code{ompt\_tool} will be seen by an OpenMP runtime, only one tool may register itself. 
If a tool-supplied implementation of \code{ompt\_tool} returns a non-\code{NULL} initializer, the OpenMP runtime will maintain state information for each OpenMP thread and will perform OMPT event callbacks registered during tool initialization. 

After a process fork, if OpenMP is re-initialized in the child process,
the OpenMP runtime in the child process will call \code{ompt\_tool} under the same conditions as it would for any process. 

\section{Tool Initialization}
\label{sec:ToolsSupport_init}

When an OpenMP runtime receives a non-\code{NULL} pointer to a tool initializer function with signature \code{ompt\_initialize\_fn\_t} as the return value from a call to a tool-provided implementation of \code{ompt\_tool}, the runtime will call the tool initializer immediately after the runtime fully initializes itself.
The initializer must be called before beginning execution of any OpenMP construct or completing any execution environment routine invocation.
The signature for the tool initializer callback is shown below:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
typedef void (*ompt_initialize_fn_t) (
  ompt_function_lookup_t lookup,
  const char *runtime_version, 
  unsigned int ompt_version
);
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

The second argument to \code{ompt\_initialize} is a version string that unambiguously identifies an OpenMP runtime implementation.
This argument is useful to tool developers trying to debug a statically-linked executable that contains both a tool implementation and an OpenMP runtime implementation.
Knowing exactly what version of an OpenMP runtime is present in a binary may be helpful when diagnosing a problem, e.g., identifying an old runtime system that may be incompatible with a newer tool.

The third argument \code{ompt\_version} indicates the version of the OMPT interface supported by a runtime system.
The version of OMPT described by this document is 2.

The two principal duties of a tool initializer are looking up pointers to all OMPT API functions that the tool uses and registering tool callbacks.
These two operations are described below.

\subsection{Looking up functions in the OMPT API.}
The first argument to \code{ompt\_initialize} is \code{lookup}---a callback that a tool must use to interrogate the runtime system to obtain pointers to all OMPT interface functions.
The type signature for \code{lookup} is:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
typedef ompt_interface_fn_t (*ompt_function_lookup_t) (
  const char *interface_function_name
);
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent
The \code{lookup} callback is necessary because, when the OpenMP runtime is dynamically loaded by a shared library, the OMPT interface functions provided by the library may not be visible to a preloaded tool.
Within a tool, one uses \code{lookup} to obtain function pointers to each function in the OMPT API.
All functions in the OMPT API are marked with \code{OMPT\_API}.
These functions should not be global symbols in an OpenMP runtime implementation to avoid tempting tool developers to call them directly. 

Below, we show how to use the \code{lookup} function to obtain a pointer to the OMPT API function \code{ompt\_get\_thread\_id}:

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
ompt_interface_fn_t ompt_get_thread_id_fn =
                        lookup("ompt_get_thread_id");
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
Other functions in the OMPT API may be looked up analogously.
If a named function is not available in an OpenMP runtime's implementation of OMPT, \code{lookup} will return \code{NULL}.

\subsection{Registering Callbacks.} 
Tools register callbacks to receive notification of various events that occur as an OpenMP program executes by using the OMPT API function \code{ompt\_set\_callback}.
The signature for this function is shown below
{
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
OMPT_API int ompt_set_callback(
  ompt_event_t event, 
  ompt_callback_t callback
);
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
}

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
return code & meaning \\\hline
0 & callback registration error (e.g., callbacks cannot be registered at this time).\\\hline
1 & event may occur; no callback is possible\\\hline
2 & event will never occur in runtime\\\hline
3 & event may occur; callback invoked when convenient\\\hline
4 & event may occur; callback always invoked when event occurs\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Meaning of return codes for {\tt ompt\_set\_callback}.}
\label{table:ToolsSupport_set_rc}
\end{table}

\noindent
The  function \code{ompt\_set\_callback} may only be called within the implementation of \code{ompt\_initialize}.
The possible return codes for \code{ompt\_set\_callback} and their meaning is shown in Table~\ref{table:ToolsSupport_set_rc}.
Registration of supported callbacks may fail if this function is called outside  \code{ompt\_initialize}.
The \code{ompt\_callback\_t} type for a callback does not reflect the actual signature of the callback; OMPT uses this generic type to avoid the need to declare a separate registration function for each actual callback type.

The OMPT API function \code{ompt\_get\_callback} may be called at any time to determine whether a callback has been registered or not. 

\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
OMPT_API int ompt_get_callback(
  ompt_event_t event, 
  ompt_callback_t *callback
);
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\noindent
If a callback has been registered, \code{ompt\_get\_callback} will return 1 and set \code{callback} to the address of the callback function; otherwise \code{ompt\_get\_callback} will return 0.



\section{Tool Data Structures}
\label{sec:data}

\subsection{Thread Identifier}
  Each OpenMP thread  has an associated identifier of type \verb|ompt_thread_id_t|. 
\begin{comment}
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
typedef uint64_t ompt_thread_id_t;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\end{comment}
  A thread's identifier is assigned when the thread is created. 
  Identifiers assigned to threads on each device are unique from the time an OpenMP runtime is initialized until it is shut down.
  A thread identifier can be retrieved
  on demand by invoking the  \verb|ompt_get_thread_id|   
  function (described in Section~\ref{sec:thread-inquiry}).
  Tools should not assume that \verb|ompt_thread_id_t| values are small or densely allocated. 
  The value \verb|ompt_thread_id_none| is reserved to indicate an invalid thread id.

\subsection{Parallel Region Identifiers}
  Each OpenMP parallel region has an associated identifier of type
  \verb|ompt_parallel_id_t|. 
\begin{comment}
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
typedef uint64_t ompt_parallel_id_t;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\end{comment}
\noindent
  A parallel region's identifier is assigned
  when the region is created.  Identifiers assigned to parallel regions on each device are unique from the time an 
  OpenMP runtime is initialized until it is shut down. 
  A parallel region identifer can be retrieved for an enclosing parallel region
  on demand using the function \verb|ompt_get_parallel_info|  (described in Section~\ref{sec:parallel-inquiry}).
  Tools should not assume that \verb|ompt_parallel_id_t| values are small or densely allocated.
  The value \verb|ompt_parallel_id_none| is reserved to indicate an invalid parallel id.
 
 
  \subsection{Task Region Identifiers}
  Each OpenMP task has an associated identifier of type
  \verb|ompt_task_id_t|. Task identifiers are assigned to
   initial, implicit, explicit, and target tasks.
\begin{comment}
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
typedef uint64_t ompt_task_id_t;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\end{comment} 
  A task's identifier is assigned
  when the task is created. 
  Identifiers assigned to tasks on each device are unique from the time an 
  OpenMP runtime is initialized until it is shut down. 
  A task's identifier can be retrieved
  on demand by invoking the \verb|ompt_get_task_info|  function (described in Section~\ref{sec:task-region}).
  Tools should not assume that \verb|ompt_task_id_t| values are small or densely allocated. 
  The value \verb|ompt_task_id_none| is reserved to indicate an invalid task identifier.
  
\subsection{Target Region and Operation Identifiers}
Each OpenMP target region and target operation has an associated identifier of type \verb|ompt_target_id_t|. 
A unique target identifier is assigned on the host each time an instance of a target construct is encountered.
Each operation within a target region, e.g., transferring data to/from a device or launching a kernel launch 
on a device, is also assigned a unique target identifier. 
Identifiers assigned to target regions or operations 
are unique from the time an OpenMP runtime is initialized until it is shut down. 
The current target region and operation identifiers can be retrieved by invoking the \verb|ompt_get_target_info| function (described in Section~\ref{sec:target-region}).
Tools should not assume that \verb|ompt_target_id_t| values are small or densely allocated. 
The value \verb|ompt_target_id_none| is reserved to indicate an invalid target identifier. 
The value \verb|ompt_target_id_none| will be returned for (a) the target region identifier if \verb|ompt_get_target_info| is invoked outside a target region and (b) the target operation identifier if \verb|ompt_get_target_info| is invoked while no target operation is in progress.

\subsection{Wait Identifiers}
Each thread instance maintains a {\em wait identifier} of type \verb|ompt_wait_id_t|. 
When a task executing on a thread is waiting for something, the thread's wait identifer indicates what the thread is awaiting. 
A wait identifier may represent a critical section {\em name}, a lock,  a program variable accessed in an atomic region, or a synchronization object internal to an OpenMP runtime implementation. 
\begin{comment}
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
typedef uint64_t ompt_wait_id_t;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\end{comment}
A thread's wait identifier can be retrieved on demand by invoking the \verb|ompt_get_state| function (described in Section~\ref{sec:thread-inquiry}).
Tools should not assume that \verb|ompt_wait_id_t| values are small or densely allocated. 
When a thread is not in a wait state, a thread's wait identifier has an undefined value.
%%? Does that mean that the value is undefined and cannot sensibley be read, or that it has a specific value which we have
%%? defined somewhere, whose name is (something like) ompt_wait_id_undefined  ?
%%johnmc says: a wait_id typically is set to the address of a lock on which you are spinning. If you aren't spinning on a lock, this value is undefined.
%%             we could zero it out, but that would cost more.
 
\subsection{Structure to Support Classification of Stack Frames}

  When executing an OpenMP program, at times procedure frames from the OpenMP runtime appear on the call stack between user code procedure frames.
  To enable a tool to classify procedure frames on the call stack as belonging to the user program or the OpenMP runtime,
  the runtime system maintains an instance of an \verb|ompt_frame_t| data structure 
  for each (possibly degenerate) task. A task is considered degenerate if a call to the OpenMP runtime to create a parallel 
  region or task does not create a new task. A degenerate task may arise when a parallel construct is encountered
   in a parallel region and nested parallelism is not enabled or when an orphaned directive that would create a task is encountered outside a parallel region.
  A degenerate task region may add runtime frames to the call stack before 
  invoking user code for the degenerate task and thus require an \verb|ompt_frame_t| data structure. 
  To simplify the discussion below, we omit the qualifier ``possibly degenerate'' each time we use the terms {\em task}.

  Each initial, implicit, explicit, or target task maintains an \verb|ompt_frame_t| data structure
  that contains a pair of pointers.   
  
\vbox{    
\begin{quote}
\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct ompt_frame_s {
    void *exit_frame;  /* runtime frame that calls user code */
    void *enter_frame; /* user frame that calls the runtime  */
} ompt_frame_t;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
}

\noindent
  An \verb|ompt_frame_t|'s  lifetime begins when a task  is
  created and ends when the task is destroyed.  Tools should not assume that a frame structure remains at a constant location in memory
  throughout a task's lifetime.
  Frame data is passed to some callbacks; it can also be retrieved
  asynchronously
  by invoking the \verb|ompt_get_task_info|  function (described in Section~\ref{sec:task-region}) in a signal handler.
  Frame data contains two components:

\begin{description}
\item \verb|exit_frame|
     This value is set before the OpenMP runtime invokes a procedure containing user code. 
%%? This description is misleading IMO. Surely this field contains the *value* of the user frame pointer. 
%%? It doesn't point to the user frame pointer, but to the user frame itself. 
%%? This language suggests another indirection which I don't believe is present.
%%johnmc says: what you described above is not how we implemented it. we set the exit_frame to the frame pointer of the runtime frame that is calling a 
%%             user procedure, not the user procedure's frame pointer.
     This field points to the frame pointer of the runtime procedure frame that invoked the user code. 
     For compilers that generate code where the master thread for a parallel region invokes user code directly (e.g., older versions of GNU compilers), 
     this may point to a frame of user code for the enclosing task.
     This value is NULL until just before the runtime invokes a procedure containing user code. 
  
\item \verb|enter_frame|
     This value is set each time the current task re-enters the 
     runtime to create a new implicit, explicit, or target task region. This field 
%%? And here too
%%johnmc says: we set the enter_frame to the frame pointer of the user procedure frame that is calling a runtime system function, not the frame pointer of 
%%             of the runtime 
     points to the frame pointer for a user function that invokes the runtime to create a task region.  
     This value is set when a task enters the runtime and cleared before the runtime returns control to the task.

\end{description}



\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{2in}|p{2in}|}
\hline
exit / enter 	& enter = null										& enter = defined \\\hline\hline
exit = null		& case 1)  initial task in user code case 2) task that is created but not yet scheduled &  task entered the runtime to schedule an implicit, explicit, or target task \\\hline
exit = defined 	& non-initial task in (or soon to be in) user code							& non-initial task entered the runtime and scheduled an implicit, explicit, or target task\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Meaning of various values for {\tt exit\_frame} and {\tt enter\_frame}.}
\label{tab:frame}
\end{table}

\noindent
Table~\ref{tab:frame} describes the meaning of this structure with various values.
In the presence of nested parallelism, a tool may observe a sequence of \verb|ompt_frame_t| records for a thread. Appendix~\ref{app:frame} discusses  an example that illustrates the use of \verb|ompt_frame_t| records with nested parallelism.

\paragraph{Advice to tool implementers:} A monitoring tool using
      asynchronous sampling can observe values of 
      \verb|exit_frame| and \verb|enter_frame| at inconvenient times. 
      Tools must be prepared to observe and handle frame exit and reenter values that have not yet been set or reset as the program enters into, or returns from, the runtime.
