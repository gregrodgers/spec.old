% This is directives.tex (Chapter 2) of the OpenMP specification.
% This is an included file. See the master file for more information.
%
% When editing this file:
%
%    1. To change formatting, appearance, or style, please edit openmp.sty.
%
%    2. Custom commands and macros are defined in openmp.sty.
%
%    3. Be kind to other editors -- keep a consistent style by copying-and-pasting to
%       create new content.
%
%    4. We use semantic markup, e.g. (see openmp.sty for a full list):
%         \code{}     % for bold monospace keywords, code, operators, etc.
%         \plc{}      % for italic placeholder names, grammar, etc.
%
%    5. There are environments that provide special formatting, e.g. language bars.
%       Please use them whereever appropriate.  Examples are:
%
%         \begin{fortranspecific}
%         This is text that appears enclosed in blue language bars for Fortran.
%         \end{fortranspecific}
%
%         \begin{note}
%         This is a note.  The "Note -- " header appears automatically.
%         \end{note}
%
%    6. Other recommendations:
%         Use the convenience macros defined in openmp.sty for the minor headers
%         such as Comments, Syntax, etc.
%
%         To keep items together on the same page, prefer the use of 
%         \begin{samepage}.... Avoid \parbox for text blocks as it interrupts line numbering.
%         When possible, avoid \filbreak, \pagebreak, \newpage, \clearpage unless that's
%         what you mean. Use \needspace{} cautiously for troublesome paragraphs.
%
%         Avoid absolute lengths and measures in this file; use relative units when possible.
%         Vertical space can be relative to \baselineskip or ex units. Horizontal space
%         can be relative to \linewidth or em units.
%
%         Prefer \emph{} to italicize terminology, e.g.:
%             This is a \emph{definition}, not a placeholder.
%             This is a \plc{var-name}.

\chapter{Directives}
\index{directives}
\label{chap:Directives}
This chapter describes the syntax and behavior of OpenMP directives, and is divided 
into the following sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item The language-specific directive format 
(\specref{sec:Directive Format})

\item Mechanisms to control conditional compilation 
(\specref{sec:Conditional Compilation})

\item Control of OpenMP API ICVs 
(\specref{sec:Internal Control Variables})

\item How to specify and to use array sections for all base languages 
(\specref{sec:Array Sections}) 

\item Details of each OpenMP directive, including associated events and tool callbacks 
(\specref{sec:parallel Construct} to 
\specref{sec:Nesting of Regions}) 
\end{itemize}

\begin{ccppspecific}
In C/C++, OpenMP directives are specified by using the \code{\#pragma} mechanism provided 
by the C and C++ standards. 
\end{ccppspecific}

\begin{fortranspecific}
In Fortran, OpenMP directives are specified by using special comments that are 
identified by unique sentinels. Also, a special comment form is available for conditional 
compilation. 
\end{fortranspecific}

Compilers can therefore ignore OpenMP directives and conditionally compiled code if 
support of the OpenMP API is not provided or enabled. A compliant implementation 
must provide an option or interface that ensures that underlying support of all OpenMP 
directives and OpenMP conditional compilation mechanisms is enabled. In the 
remainder of this document, the phrase \emph{OpenMP compilation} is used to mean a 
compilation with these OpenMP features enabled.

\begin{samepage}
\begin{fortranspecific}
\restrictions
The following restriction applies to all OpenMP directives: 
\begin{itemize}
\item OpenMP directives, except SIMD and \code{declare}~\code{target} directives,
 may not appear in pure procedures.
\end{itemize}
\end{fortranspecific}
\end{samepage}
