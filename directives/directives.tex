\chapter{Directives}
\index{directives}
\label{chap:Directives}
This chapter describes the syntax and behavior of OpenMP directives, and is divided 
into the following sections:

\begin{itemize}
\item The language-specific directive format 
(\specref{sec:Directive Format})

\item Mechanisms to control conditional compilation 
(\specref{sec:Conditional Compilation})

\item Control of OpenMP API ICVs 
(\specref{sec:Internal Control Variables})

\item How to specify and to use array sections for all base languages 
(\specref{sec:Array Sections}) 

\item Details of each OpenMP directive, including associated events and tool callbacks 
(\specref{sec:parallel Construct} to 
\specref{sec:Nesting of Regions}) 
\end{itemize}

\ccppspecificstart
In C/C++, OpenMP directives are specified by using the \code{\#pragma} mechanism provided 
by the C and C++ standards. 
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
In Fortran, OpenMP directives are specified by using special comments that are 
identified by unique sentinels. Also, a special comment form is available for conditional 
compilation. 
\fortranspecificend

Compilers can therefore ignore OpenMP directives and conditionally compiled code if 
support of the OpenMP API is not provided or enabled. A compliant implementation 
must provide an option or interface that ensures that underlying support of all OpenMP 
directives and OpenMP conditional compilation mechanisms is enabled. In the 
remainder of this document, the phrase \emph{OpenMP compilation} is used to mean a 
compilation with these OpenMP features enabled.

\begin{samepage}
\fortranspecificstart
\restrictions
The following restriction applies to all OpenMP directives: 
\begin{itemize}
\item OpenMP directives, except SIMD and \code{declare}~\code{target} directives,
 may not appear in pure procedures.
\end{itemize}

\section{Combined Constructs}
\label{sec:Combined Constructs}
\index{combined constructs}
\index{constructs!combined constructs}
Combined constructs are shortcuts for specifying one construct immediately nested 
inside another construct. The semantics of the combined constructs are identical to that 
of explicitly specifying the first construct containing one instance of the second 
construct and no other statements.

Some combined constructs have clauses that are permitted on both constructs that were
combined. Where specified, the effect is as if applying the clauses to one or both
constructs. If not specified and applying the clause to one construct would result in
different program behavior than applying the clause to the other construct then the
program's behavior is unspecified.

For combined constructs, tool callbacks shall be invoked as if the constructs were
explicitly nested.

\syntax
\ccppspecificstart
The syntax of the parallel loop construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
\#pragma omp parallel for \plc{[clause[ [},\plc{] clause] ... ] new-line}
   \plc{for-loops}
\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{clause} can be any of the clauses accepted by the \code{parallel} or \code{for} directives, 
except the \code{nowait} clause, with identical meanings and restrictions.
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart

\begin{boxedcode}
!\$omp parallel do \plc{[clause[ [},\plc{] clause] ... ]}

\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{clause} can be any of the clauses accepted by the \code{parallel} or \code{do} directives,

If an \code{end}~\code{parallel}~\code{do} directive is not specified, an \code{end}~\code{parallel}~\code{do} directive is 
assumed at the end of the \plc{do-loops}. \code{nowait} may not be specified on an 
\code{end}~\code{parallel}~\code{do} directive.

The \code{teams}~\code{distribute} construct is a shortcut for specifying a \code{teams} construct 
containing a \code{distribute} construct and no other statements.

\syntax
\ccppspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{teams}~\code{distribute} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
\#pragma omp teams distribute \plc{[clause[ [},\plc{] clause] ... ] new-line}
    \plc{for-loops}

\index{if Clause@{\code{if} Clause}}
\label{sec:if Clause}

\summary
The semantics of an \code{if} clause are described in the section on the
construct to which it applies. 
The \code{if} clause \plc{directive-name-modifier} names the associated
construct to which an expression applies, and is particularly useful for 
composite and combined constructs.

\syntax
\ccppspecificstart

The syntax of the \code{if} clause is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
if(\plc{[ directive-name-modifier }:\plc{] scalar-expression}) 
\end{boxedcode}
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart

The syntax of the \code{if} clause is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
if(\plc{[ directive-name-modifier }:\plc{] scalar-logical-expression}) 
\end{boxedcode}
\fortranspecificend

\descr
The effect of the \code{if} clause depends on the construct to 
which it is applied. For combined or composite constructs, the
\code{if} clause only applies to the semantics of the construct 
named in the \plc{directive-name-modifier} if one is specified. 
If no  \plc{directive-name-modifier} is specified for a combined 
or composite construct then the \code{if} clause applies to all 
constructs to which an \code{if} clause can apply.




\section{Master and Synchronization Constructs and Clauses}
\label{sec:Master and Synchronization Constructs and Clauses}
\index{master and synchronization constructs and clauses}
\index{synchronization constructs}
OpenMP provides the following synchronization constructs:
\begin{itemize}
\item the \code{master} construct;

\item the \code{critical} construct;

\item the \code{barrier} construct;

\item the \code{taskwait} construct;

\item the \code{taskgroup} construct;

\item the \code{atomic} construct;

\item the \code{flush} construct;

\item the \code{ordered} construct.
\end{itemize}










\subsection{\code{master} Construct}
\index{maste@{\code{master}}}
\index{constructs!master@{\code{master}}}
\label{subsec:master Construct}
\summary
The \code{master} construct specifies a structured block that is executed by the master thread 
of the team.

\syntax
\ccppspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{master} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
\#pragma omp master \plc{new-line}
   \plc{structured-block}
\end{boxedcode}
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{master} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
!\$omp master
   \plc{structured-block}
!\$omp end master
\end{boxedcode}
\fortranspecificend

\binding
The binding thread set for a \code{master} region is the current team. A \code{master} region 
binds to the innermost enclosing \code{parallel} region. Only the master thread of the team 
executing the binding \code{parallel} region participates in the execution of the structured 
block of the \code{master} region.

\descr
Other threads in the team do not execute the associated structured block. There is no 
implied barrier either on entry to, or exit from, the \code{master} construct.

\events

The \plc{master-begin} event occurs in the thread encountering the \code{master}
construct on entry to the master region, if it is the master thread of the team.

The \plc{master-end} event occurs in the thread encountering the \code{master}
construct on exit of the master region, if it is the master thread of the team.

\tools

A thread dispatches a registered \code{ompt\_callback\_master}
callback for each occurrence of a \plc{master-begin} and a
\plc{master-end} event in that thread.  

The callback occurs  in the context of the task executed by the master thread.
This callback has the type signature
\code{ompt\_callback\_master\_t}. The callback receives
\code{ompt\_scope\_begin} or \code{ompt\_scope\_end} 
as its \plc{endpoint} argument, as appropriate.

\restrictions
\cppspecificstart
\begin{itemize}
\item A throw executed inside a \code{master} region must cause execution to resume within the 
same \code{master} region, and the same thread that threw the exception must catch it
\end{itemize}
\cppspecificend

\subsection{\code{critical} Construct}
\index{critical@{\code{critical}}}
\index{constructs!critical@{\code{critical}}}
\label{subsec:critical Construct}
\summary
The \code{critical} construct restricts execution of the associated structured block to a 
single thread at a time.

\syntax
\ccppspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{critical} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
\#pragma omp critical \plc{[}(\plc{name}) \plc{[}hint(\plc{hint-expression})\plc{] ] new-line}
    \plc{structured-block}
\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{hint-expression} is an integer constant expression that
evaluates to a valid lock hint (as described 
in~\specref{subsec:omp_init_lock_with_hint and omp_init_nest_lock_with_hint}).
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{critical} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
!\$omp critical \plc{[}(\plc{name}) \plc{[}hint(\plc{hint-expression})\plc{] ]}
    \plc{structured-block}
!\$omp end critical \plc{[}(\plc{name})\plc{]}  
\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{hint-expression} is a constant expression that evaluates to
a scalar value with kind \code{omp\_lock\_hint\_kind} and  a value
that is a valid lock hint (as described 
in~\specref{subsec:omp_init_lock_with_hint and omp_init_nest_lock_with_hint}).
\fortranspecificend

\binding
The binding thread set for a \code{critical} region is all threads in the contention group. 
The region is executed as if only a single thread at a time among all threads in the 
contention group is entering the region for execution, without regard to the team(s) to which the threads belong. 

\descr
An optional \plc{name} may be used to identify the \code{critical} construct. All \code{critical} 
constructs without a name are considered to have the same unspecified name. 

\ccppspecificstart
Identifiers used to identify a \code{critical} construct have external linkage and are in a 
name space that is separate from the name spaces used by labels, tags, members, and 
ordinary identifiers.
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
The names of \code{critical} constructs are global entities of the program. If a name 
conflicts with any other entity, the behavior of the program is unspecified.
\fortranspecificend

The threads of a contention group execute the \code{critical} region as if only one thread of the contention group is executing the \code{critical} region at a time.
The \code{critical} construct enforces these execution semantics with respect to all \code{critical} constructs with the same name in all 
threads in the contention group, not just those threads in the current team.

The presence of a \code{hint} clause does not affect the isolation
guarantees provided by the \code{critical} construct. If no

\subsection{\code{barrier} Construct}
\index{barrier@{\code{barrier}}}

\label{subsec:barrier Construct}
\summary
The \code{barrier} construct specifies an explicit barrier at the point at which the construct 
appears. The \code{barrier} construct is a stand-alone directive.

\syntax
\ccppspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{barrier} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
\#pragma omp barrier \plc{new-line}
\end{boxedcode}
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{barrier} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
!\$omp barrier
\end{boxedcode}
\fortranspecificend

\binding
The binding thread set for a \code{barrier} region is the current team. A \code{barrier} region 
binds to the innermost enclosing \code{parallel} region. 

\descr
All threads of the team executing the binding \code{parallel} region must execute the 
\code{barrier} region and complete execution of all explicit tasks bound to this \code{parallel} 
region before any are allowed to continue execution beyond the barrier.

The \code{barrier} region includes an implicit task scheduling point in the current task 
region.

\def\omptSyncRegionEvents#1{
The \plc{#1-begin} event occurs in each thread encountering the
\code{#1} construct on entry to the \code{#1} region.

The \plc{#1-wait-begin} event occurs when a task begins an interval of active or passive waiting
in a \code{#1} region. 

The \plc{#1-wait-end} event occurs when a task ends an interval of active or passive waiting
and resumes execution in a \code{#1} region. 

The \plc{#1-end} event occurs in each thread encountering the
\code{#1} construct after the #1 synchronization on exit from the
\code{#1} region.

\code{ompt\_callback\_sync\_region\_t}. 
The callback receives
\code{ompt\_sync\_region\_#1} as its \plc{kind} argument and
\code{ompt\_scope\_begin} or \code{ompt\_scope\_end} 
as its \plc{endpoint} argument, as appropriate.

A thread dispatches a registered

The callback receives \code{ompt\_cancel\_detected} as its \plc{flags} argument. 

\restrictions
The following restrictions apply to the \code{barrier} construct:

\begin{itemize}
\item Each \code{barrier} region must be encountered by all threads in a team or by none at all, 
unless cancellation has been requested for the innermost enclosing parallel region.

\item The sequence of worksharing regions and \code{barrier} regions encountered must be the 
same for every thread in a team.

\subsection{Implicit Barriers}
\index{implicit barrier}
\index{barrier, implicit}
\label{subsec:implict-barrier}

Implicit tasks in a parallel region synchronize with one another using
implicit barriers at the end of worksharing constructs and at the end
of the \code{parallel} region. This section describes the OMPT events and
tool callbacks associated with implicit barriers.

Implicit barriers are task scheduling points. For a description of
task sheduling points, associated events, and tool callbacks, see
\specref{subsec:Task Scheduling}.

\events

A \plc{cancellation} event occurs if cancellation is activated at an
implicit cancellation point in an implicit barrier region.

The \plc{implicit-barrier-begin} event occurs in each implicit task
at the beginning of an implicit barrier.

The \plc{implicit-barrier-wait-begin} event occurs when a task begins an interval of
active or passive waiting while executing in an implicit barrier region.

The \plc{implicit-barrier-wait-end} event occurs when a task ends an interval of 
active or waiting and resumes execution of an implicit barrier region.

The \plc{implicit-barrier-end} event occurs in each implicit task
at the end of an implicit barrier.

\tools

A thread dispatches a registered \code{ompt\_callback\_sync\_region}
callback for each occurrence of a \plc{implicit-barrier-begin} and
\plc{implicit-barrier-end} event in that thread.  The callback occurs
in the implicit task executing in a parallel region.
This callback has the type signature
\code{ompt\_callback\_sync\_region\_t}.  The callback receives
\code{ompt\_sync\_region\_barrier} as its \plc{kind} argument and
\code{ompt\_scope\_begin} or \code{ompt\_scope\_end} as its
\plc{endpoint} argument, as appropriate.

A thread dispatches a registered \code{ompt\_callback\_cancel}
callback for each occurrence of a \plc{cancellation} event in that thread.
The callback occurs in the context of the encountering task.  The
callback has type signature \code{ompt\_callback\_cancel\_t}.  The
callback receives \code{ompt\_cancel\_detected} as its \plc{flags}
argument.

A thread dispatches a registered
\code{ompt\_callback\_sync\_region\_wait} callback for each occurrence
of a \plc{implicit-barrier-wait-begin} and
\plc{implicit-barrier-wait-end} event.  This callback has type
signature \code{ompt\_callback\_sync\_region\_t}.  The callback occurs
in each implicit task participating in an implicit barrier.  The
callback receives \code{ompt\_sync\_region\_barrier} as its \plc{kind}
argument and \code{ompt\_scope\_begin} or \code{ompt\_scope\_end} as
its \plc{endpoint} argument, as appropriate.

\restrictions
If a thread is in the state \code{omp\_state\_wait\_barrier\_implicit\_parallel},
a call to \code{ompt\_get\_parallel\_info}
may return a pointer to a copy of the current parallel region's \plc{parallel\_data}
rather than a pointer to the data word for the region itself. This convention enables the master thread
for a parallel region to free storage for the region immediately after the region ends, yet
avoid having some other thread in the region's team
potentially reference the region's \plc{parallel\_data} object after it has been freed.

\subsection{\code{taskwait} Construct}
\index{taskwait@{\code{taskwait}}}
\index{constructs!taskwait@{\code{taskwait}}}
\label{subsec:taskwait Construct}
\summary
The \code{taskwait} construct specifies a wait on the completion of child tasks
of the current task. The \code{taskwait} construct is a stand-alone directive.

\syntax
\ccppspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{taskwait} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
\#pragma omp taskwait \plc{[clause[ [},\plc{] clause] ... ] new-line}
\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{clause} is one of the following:

\begin{indentedcodelist}
depend(\plc{dependence-type }:\plc{ locator-list})
\end{indentedcodelist}
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{taskwait} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
!\$omp taskwait \plc{[clause[ [},\plc{] clause] ... ]}
\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{clause} is one of the following:

\begin{indentedcodelist}
depend(\plc{dependence-type }:\plc{ locator-list})
\end{indentedcodelist}

\fortranspecificend

\binding
The \code{taskwait} region binds to the current task region. The binding thread set of the 
\code{taskwait} region is the current team.

\descr

If no \code{depend} clause is present on the \code{taskwait} construct, the
current task region is suspended at an implicit task scheduling point
associated with the construct. The current task region remains suspended until
all child tasks that it generated before the \code{taskwait} region complete
execution.

Otherwise, if one or more \code{depend} clauses are present on the
\code{taskwait} construct, the behavior is as if these clauses were applied to
a \code{task} construct with an empty associated structured block that
generates a \emph{mergeable} and \emph{included task}. Thus, the current task region is
suspended until the \emph{predecessor tasks} of this task complete execution.

\summary
The \code{taskgroup} construct specifies a wait on completion of child tasks of the current 
task and their descendent tasks.

\syntax
\ccppspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{taskgroup} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}

where \plc{clause} is one of the following:

\begin{indentedcodelist}
task_reduction(\plc{reduction-identifier }:\plc{ list})
\end{indentedcodelist}

\fortranspecificend

\binding
A \code{taskgroup} region binds to the current task region. A \code{taskgroup} region binds to 
the innermost enclosing \code{parallel} region. 

\descr
When a thread encounters a \code{taskgroup} construct, it starts executing 
the region. All child tasks generated in the \code{taskgroup} region and all 
of their descendants that bind to the same \code{parallel} region as the 
\code{taskgroup} region are part of the \plc{taskgroup set} associated with 
the \code{taskgroup} region.

There is an implicit task scheduling point at the end of the \code{taskgroup} 
region. The current task is suspended at the task scheduling point until all 
tasks in the \plc{taskgroup set} complete execution.

\binding
If the size of \plc{x} is 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits and \plc{x} is aligned to a
multiple of its size, the binding thread set for the \code{atomic} region is 
all threads on the device. Otherwise, the binding thread set for the 
\code{atomic} region is all threads in the contention group.  \code{atomic} 
regions enforce exclusive access with respect to other \code{atomic} regions 
that access the same storage location \plc{x} among all threads in the 
binding thread set without regard to the teams to which the threads belong. 

\descr
The \code{atomic} construct with the \code{read} clause forces an atomic read of the location 
designated by \plc{x} regardless of the native machine word size.
\end{samepage}

The \code{atomic} construct with the \code{write} clause forces an atomic write of the location 
designated by \plc{x} regardless of the native machine word size.

The \code{atomic} construct with the \code{update} clause forces an atomic update of the location 
designated by \plc{x} using the designated operator or intrinsic. Note that when no clause is 
present, the semantics are equivalent to atomic update. Only the read and write of the 
location designated by \plc{x} are performed mutually atomically. The evaluation of \plc{expr} or 
\plc{expr\_list} need not be atomic with respect to the read or write of the location designated 
by \plc{x}. No task scheduling points are allowed between the read and the write of the 
location designated by \plc{x}.

The \code{atomic} construct with the \code{capture} clause forces an atomic update of the 
location designated by \plc{x} using the designated operator or intrinsic while also capturing 
the original or final value of the location designated by \plc{x} with respect to the atomic 
update. The original or final value of the location designated by \plc{x} is written in the 
location designated by \plc{v} depending on the form of the \code{atomic} construct structured 
block or statements following the usual language semantics. Only the read and write of 
the location designated by \plc{x} are performed mutually atomically. Neither the evaluation 
of \plc{expr} or \plc{expr\_list}, nor the write to the location designated by \plc{v}, need be atomic with
respect to the read or write of the location designated by \plc{x}. No task scheduling points 
are allowed between the read and the write of the location designated by \plc{x}.

Any \code{atomic} construct with a \code{seq\_cst} clause forces the atomically performed 
operation to include an implicit flush operation without a list.

\notestart
\noteheader -- As with other implicit flush regions, 
\specref{subsec:OpenMP Memory Consistency} 
reduces the 
ordering that must be enforced. The intent is that, when the analogous operation exists 
in C++11 or C11, a sequentially consistent \code{atomic} construct has the same semantics as 
a \code{memory\_order\_seq\_cst} atomic operation in C++11/C11. Similarly, a 
non-sequentially consistent \code{atomic} construct has the same semantics as a 
\code{memory\_order\_relaxed} atomic operation in C++11/C11.

Unlike non-sequentially consistent \code{atomic} constructs, sequentially consistent \code{atomic} 
constructs preserve the interleaving (sequentially consistent) behavior of correct, 
data race free programs. However, they are not designed to replace the \code{flush} directive 
as a mechanism to enforce ordering for non-sequentially consistent \code{atomic} constructs, 
and attempts to do so require extreme caution. For example, a sequentially consistent 
\code{atomic}~\code{write} construct may appear to be reordered with a subsequent 
non-sequentially consistent \code{atomic}~\code{write} construct, since such reordering would not 
be observable by a correct program if the second write were outside an \code{atomic} 
directive.
\noteend

For all forms of the \code{atomic} construct, any combination of two or more
of these \code{atomic} constructs enforces mutually exclusive access to the
locations designated by \plc{x} among threads in the binding thread set.  To
avoid race conditions, all accesses of the locations designated by \plc{x}
that could potentially occur in parallel must be protected with an
\code{atomic} construct. 

\code{atomic} regions do not guarantee exclusive access with respect to any accesses outside 
of \code{atomic} regions to the same storage location \plc{x} even if those accesses occur during a 
\code{critical} or \code{ordered} region, while an OpenMP lock is owned by the executing 
task, or during the execution of a \code{reduction} clause.

However, other OpenMP synchronization can ensure the desired exclusive access. For 
example, a barrier following a series of atomic updates to \plc{x} guarantees that subsequent 
accesses do not form a race with the atomic accesses. 

A compliant implementation may enforce exclusive access between \code{atomic} regions 
that update different storage locations. The circumstances under which this occurs are 
implementation defined. 

If the storage location designated by \plc{x} is not size-aligned (that is, if the byte alignment 
of \plc{x} is not a multiple of the size of \plc{x}), then the behavior of the \code{atomic} region is 
implementation defined.

\subsection{\code{flush} Construct}
\index{flush@{\code{flush}}}
\index{constructs!flush@{\code{flush}}}
\label{subsec:flush Construct}
\summary
The \code{flush} construct executes the OpenMP flush operation. This operation makes a 
thread’s temporary view of memory consistent with memory and enforces an order on 
the memory operations of the variables explicitly specified or implied. See the memory 
model description in \specref{sec:Memory Model} for more details. The \code{flush} construct is a 
stand-alone directive.

\syntax
\ccppspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{flush} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
\#pragma omp flush \plc{[}(\plc{list})\plc{] new-line}
\end{boxedcode}
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{flush} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
!\$omp flush \plc{[}(\plc{list})\plc{]}
\end{boxedcode}
\fortranspecificend

\binding
The binding thread set for a \code{flush} region is the encountering thread. Execution of a 
\code{flush} region affects the memory and the temporary view of memory of only the thread 
that executes the region. It does not affect the temporary view of other threads. Other 
threads must themselves execute a flush operation in order to be guaranteed to observe 
the effects of the encountering thread’s flush operation

\descr
A \code{flush} construct without a list, executed on a given thread, operates as if the whole 
thread-visible data state of the program, as defined by the base language, is flushed. A 
\code{flush} construct with a list applies the flush operation to the items in the list, and does 
not return until the operation is complete for all specified list items. An implementation 
may implement a \code{flush} with a list by ignoring the list, and treating it the same as a 
\code{flush} without a list.

\ccppspecificstart
If a pointer is present in the list, the pointer itself is flushed, not the memory block to 
which the pointer refers.
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
If the list item or a subobject of the list item has the \code{POINTER} attribute, the allocation 
or association status of the \code{POINTER} item is flushed, but the pointer target is not. If the 
list item is a Cray pointer, the pointer is flushed, but the object to which it points is not. 
If the list item is of type \code{C\_PTR}, the variable is flushed, but the storage that corresponds 
to that address is not flushed. If the list item or the subobject of the list item has the 
\code{ALLOCATABLE} attribute and has an allocation status of allocated, the
allocated variable is flushed; otherwise the allocation status is flushed.
\fortranspecificend

\begin{samepage}
\notestart
\noteheader -- Use of a \code{flush} construct with a list is extremely error prone and users are 
strongly discouraged from attempting it. The following examples illustrate the ordering 
properties of the flush operation. In the following incorrect pseudocode example, the 
programmer intends to prevent simultaneous execution of the protected section by the 
two threads, but the program does not work properly because it does not enforce the 
proper ordering of the operations on variables \code{a} and \code{b}. Any shared data accessed in the 
protected section is not guaranteed to be current or consistent during or after the 
protected section. The atomic notation in the pseudocode in the following two examples 
indicates that the accesses to \code{a} and \code{b} are \code{ATOMIC} writes and captures. Otherwise both 
examples would contain data races and automatically result in unspecified behavior. 
\end{samepage}

The problem with this example is that operations on variables \code{a} and \code{b} are not ordered 
with respect to each other. For instance, nothing prevents the compiler from moving the 
flush of \code{b} on thread 1 or the flush of \code{a} on thread 2 to a position completely after the 
protected section (assuming that the protected section on thread 1 does not reference \code{b} and 
the protected section on thread 2 does not reference \code{a}). If either re-ordering happens, both 
threads can simultaneously execute the protected section.

The following pseudocode example correctly ensures that the protected section is executed 
by not more than one of the two threads at any one time. Execution of the 
protected section by neither thread is considered correct in this example. This occurs if 
both flushes complete prior to either thread executing its \code{if} statement.

\subsection{\code{ordered} Construct}
\index{ordered@{\code{ordered}}}
\index{constructs!ordered@{\code{ordered}}}
\label{subsec:ordered Construct}
\summary
The \code{ordered} construct either specifies a structured block in a loop,
\code{simd}, or loop SIMD region that will be executed in the order of the
loop iterations, or it is a stand-alone directive that specifies
cross-iteration dependences in a doacross loop nest. The \code{ordered}
construct sequentializes and orders the execution of \code{ordered} regions
while allowing code outside the region to run in parallel.

\begin{samepage}
\syntax
\ccppspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{ordered} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
\#pragma omp ordered \plc{[clause[ [},\plc{] clause] ]} \plc{new-line}
   \plc{structured-block}
\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{clause} is one of the following:
\begin{indentedcodelist}
threads
simd
\end{indentedcodelist}

or

\begin{boxedcode}
\#pragma omp ordered \plc{clause [[[},\plc{] clause] ... ]} \plc{new-line}
\end{boxedcode}
where \plc{clause} is one of the following:
\begin{indentedcodelist}
depend(source)
depend(sink : \plc{vec})
\end{indentedcodelist}


\ccppspecificend
\end{samepage}

\fortranspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{ordered} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
!\$omp ordered \plc{[clause[ [},\plc{] clause] ]}
    \plc{structured-block}
!\$omp end ordered
\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{clause} is one of the following:
\begin{indentedcodelist}
threads
simd
\end{indentedcodelist}

or

\begin{boxedcode}
!\$omp ordered \plc{clause [[[},\plc{] clause] ... ]}
\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{clause} is one of the following:
\begin{indentedcodelist}
depend(source)
depend(sink : \plc{vec})
\end{indentedcodelist}
\fortranspecificend

If the \code{depend} clause is specified, the \code{ordered} construct is a stand-alone directive.
 
\binding
The binding thread set for an \code{ordered} region is the current team. An \code{ordered} region 
binds to the innermost enclosing \code{simd} or loop SIMD region if the
\code{simd} clause is present, and otherwise it binds to the innermost
enclosing loop region. \code{ordered} regions that bind to different regions
execute independently of each other.

\descr
If no clause is specified, the \code{ordered} construct behaves as if the
\code{threads} clause had been specified. If the \code{threads} clause is
specified, the threads in the team executing the loop region execute
\code{ordered} regions sequentially in the order of the loop iterations.
If any \code{depend} clauses are specified then those clauses specify the 
order in which the threads in the team execute \code{ordered} regions. If
the \code{simd} clause is specified, the \code{ordered} regions encountered by
any thread will use only a single SIMD lane to execute the \code{ordered}
regions in the order of the loop iterations.

When the thread executing the first iteration of the loop encounters an
\code{ordered} construct, it can enter the \code{ordered} region without
waiting. When a thread executing any subsequent iteration encounters an
\code{ordered} construct without a \code{depend} clause, it waits at the
beginning of the \code{ordered} region until execution of all \code{ordered}
regions belonging to all previous iterations has completed. When a thread
executing any subsequent iteration encounters an \code{ordered} construct with
one or more \code{depend(sink:\plc{vec})} clauses, it waits until its dependences on 
all valid iterations specified by the \code{depend} clauses
are satisfied before it completes execution of the \code{ordered} region.
A specific dependence is satisfied when a thread executing the corresponding
iteration encounters an \code{ordered} construct with a \code{depend(source)} clause.

\subsection{\code{depend} Clause}
\index{depend@{\code{depend}}}
\index{clauses!depend@{\code{depend}}}
\label{subsec:depend Clause}
\summary
The \code{depend} clause enforces additional constraints on the scheduling of tasks or loop iterations.  These 
constraints establish dependences only between sibling tasks or between loop iterations. 

\syntax
The syntax of the \code{depend} clause is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
depend(\plc{dependence-type }:\plc{ locator-list})
\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{dependence-type} is one of the following:
\begin{indentedcodelist}
in
out
inout
\end{indentedcodelist}

or

\begin{boxedcode}
depend(\plc{dependence-type})
\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{dependence-type} is:
\begin{indentedcodelist}
source
\end{indentedcodelist}

or

\begin{boxedcode}
depend(\plc{dependence-type} : \plc{vec})
\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{dependence-type} is:
\begin{indentedcodelist}
sink
\end{indentedcodelist}

and where \plc{vec} is the iteration vector, which has the form:

x$_{1}$ [$\pm $ d$_{1}$], x$_{2}$ [$\pm $ d$_{2}$], \ldots, x$_{\plc{n}}$ [$\pm $ d$_{\plc{n}}$]

where \plc{n} is the value specified by the \code{ordered} clause in the loop
directive, x$_{\plc{i}}$ denotes the loop iteration variable of the \plc{i}-th
nested loop associated with the loop directive, and d$_{\plc{i}}$ is a
constant non-negative integer.

\descr
Task dependences are derived from the \plc{dependence-type} of a \code{depend} clause and its list 
items when \plc{dependence-type} is \code{in}, \code{out}, or \code{inout}.

For the \code{in} \plc{dependence-type}, if the storage location of at least one
of the list items is the same as the storage location of a list item appearing
in a \code{depend} clause with an \code{out} or \code{inout} \plc{dependence-type} on a construct
from which a sibling task was previously generated, then the generated task
will be a dependent task of that sibling task.

For the \code{out} and \code{inout} \plc{dependence-types}, if the storage location of at least one
of the list items is the same as the storage location of a list item appearing
in a \code{depend} clause with an \code{in}, \code{out}, or \code{inout} \plc{dependence-type} on
a construct from which a sibling task was previously generated, then the
generated task will be a dependent task of that sibling task.

\fortranspecificstart
If a list item has the \code{ALLOCATABLE} attribute and its allocation
status is unallocated, the behavior is unspecified. If a list item has
the \code{POINTER} attribute and its association status is
disassociated or undefined, the behavior is unspecified.

The list items that appear in the \code{depend} clause may include array sections.

\notestart
\noteheader -- The enforced task dependence establishes a synchronization of memory

\noteend

The \code{source} \plc{dependence-type} specifies the satisfaction of
cross-iteration dependences that arise from the current iteration.

The \code{sink} \plc{dependence-type} specifies a cross-iteration dependence,
where the iteration vector \plc{vec} indicates the iteration that satisfies
the dependence.

If the iteration vector \plc{vec} does not occur in the iteration space,
the \code{depend} clause is ignored.  If all \code{depend} clauses on an
\code{ordered} construct are ignored then the construct is ignored.

\events

The \plc{task-dependences} event occurs in a thread encountering a
tasking construct with a \code{depend} clause immediately after the
\plc{task-create} event for the new task.  

The \plc{task-dependence} event indicates an unfulfilled dependence for the generated task.
This event occurs in a thread that observes the unfulfilled dependence before it is satisfied.
%unfulfilled dependence... already implies that if the dependence is satisfied (not unfulfilled)

\tools

A thread dispatches the \code{ompt\_callback\_task\_dependences} callback
for each occurrence of the \plc{task-dependences} event to 
announce its dependences with respect to the list items in the \code{depend} clause.
This callback has type signature
\code{ompt\_callback\_task\_dependences\_t}.

A thread dispatches the \code{ompt\_callback\_task\_dependence}
callback for a \plc{task-dependence} event to report a
dependence between a predecessor task  (\plc{src\_task\_data}) and a dependent task
(\plc{sink\_task\_data}).  This callback has type signature
\code{ompt\_callback\_task\_dependence\_t}.

\restrictions
Restrictions to the \code{depend} clause are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item List items used in \code{depend} clauses of the same task or sibling tasks must indicate 
identical storage locations or disjoint storage locations. 

\item List items used in \code{depend} clauses cannot be zero-length array sections. 

\fortranspecificstart
\item A common block name cannot appear in a \code{depend} clause.
\fortranspecificend

\item For a \plc{vec} element of \code{sink} \plc{dependence-type} of the form
x$_{i}$ $+$ d$_{i}$ or x$_{i}$ $-$ d$_{i}$ if the loop iteration variable
x$_{i}$ has an integral or pointer type, the expression x$_{i}$ $+$ d$_{i}$ or
x$_{i}$ $-$ d$_{i}$ for any value of the loop iteration variable x$_{i}$ that
can encounter the \code{ordered} construct must be computable in the
loop iteration variable's type without overflow.

\item For a \plc{vec} element of \code{sink} \plc{dependence-type} of the form
x$_{i}$ $+$ d$_{i}$ or x$_{i}$ $-$ d$_{i}$ if the loop iteration variable
x$_{i}$ is of a random access iterator type other than pointer type,
the expression $($ x$_{i}$ - lb$_{i}$ $)$ $+$ d$_{i}$ or
$($ x$_{i}$ - lb$_{i}$ $)$ $-$ d$_{i}$ for any value of the loop iteration variable
x$_{i}$ that can encounter the \code{ordered} construct must be computable in the
type that would be used by \plc{std::distance} applied to variables of the
type of x$_{i}$ without overflow.

\label{subsec:cancel Construct}
\summary
The \code{cancel} construct activates cancellation of the innermost enclosing region of the 
type specified. The \code{cancel} construct is a stand-alone directive.

\syntax
\ccppspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{cancel} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
\#pragma omp cancel \plc{construct-type-clause [ [},\plc{] if-clause] new-line}
\end{boxedcode}

\begin{samepage}
where \plc{construct-type-clause} is one of the following:

\begin{indentedcodelist}
parallel
sections
for
taskgroup
\end{indentedcodelist}
\end{samepage}

and \plc{if-clause} is
\begin{indentedcodelist}
if (\plc{[} cancel :\plc{] scalar-expression})
\end{indentedcodelist}
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{cancel} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
!\$omp cancel \plc{construct-type-clause [ [},\plc{] if-clause]}
\end{boxedcode}
\vspace{-1.5ex} %% HACK

\begin{samepage}
where \plc{construct-type-clause} is one of the following:
\begin{indentedcodelist}
parallel
sections
do
taskgroup
\end{indentedcodelist}
\end{samepage}

and \plc{if-clause} is
\begin{indentedcodelist}
if (\plc{[} cancel :\plc{] scalar-logical-expression})
\end{indentedcodelist}
\fortranspecificend


\binding
The binding thread set of the \code{cancel} region is the current team.
The binding region of the \code{cancel} region 
is the innermost enclosing region of the type corresponding to the \plc{construct-type-clause} 
specified in the directive (that is, the innermost \code{parallel}, \code{sections}, loop, or 
\code{taskgroup} region).

\descr
The \code{cancel} construct activates cancellation of the binding region only if the \plc{cancel-var} ICV
is \plc{true}, in which case the \code{cancel} construct causes the encountering task to continue execution 
at the end of the binding region if \plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{parallel}, \code{for}, \code{do}, or \code{sections}. 
If the \plc{cancel-var} ICV is \plc{true} and \plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{taskgroup}, the encountering task continues execution at the end of the current task region.
If the \plc{cancel-var} ICV is \plc{false}, the \code{cancel} construct is 
ignored.

Threads check for active cancellation only at cancellation points that are 
implied at the following locations:

\begin{itemize}
\item \code{cancel} regions;
\item \code{cancellation}~\code{point} regions;
\item \code{barrier} regions;
\item implicit barriers regions.
\end{itemize}

When a thread reaches one of the above cancellation points and if the \plc{cancel-var} ICV is \plc{true},  then:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the thread is at a \code{cancel} or \code{cancellation point} region 
and \plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{parallel}, \code{for}, \code{do}, or 
\code{sections}, the thread continues execution at the end of the canceled 
region if cancellation has been activated for the innermost enclosing region 
of the type specified.

\item If the thread is at a \code{cancel} or \code{cancellation point} region 
and \plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{taskgroup}, the encountering task 
checks for active cancellation of all of the \plc{taskgroup sets} to which the 
encountering task belongs, and continues execution at the end of the current 
task region if cancellation has been activated for any of the \plc{taskgroup sets}.

\item If the encountering task is at a barrier region, the encountering task 
checks for active cancellation of the innermost enclosing \code{parallel} 
region. If cancellation has been activated, then the encountering task 
continues execution at the end of the canceled region.
\end{itemize}

\newpage %% HACK
\notestart
\noteheader -- If one thread activates cancellation and another thread encounters a cancellation 
point, the order of execution between the two threads is non-deterministic. 
Whether the thread that encounters a cancellation point detects the activated cancellation 
depends on the underlying hardware and operating system.
\noteend

When cancellation of tasks is activated through the
\code{cancel}~\code{taskgroup} construct, the tasks that belong to the
\plc{taskgroup set} of the innermost enclosing \code{taskgroup} region
will be canceled. The task that encountered the
\code{cancel}~\code{taskgroup} construct continues execution at the
end of its \code{task} region, which implies completion of that
task. Any task that belongs to the innermost enclosing
\code{taskgroup} and has already begun execution must run to
completion or until a cancellation point is reached. Upon reaching a
cancellation point and if cancellation is active, the task continues
execution at the end of its \code{task} region, which implies the
task's completion. Any task that belongs to the innermost enclosing
\code{taskgroup} and that has not begun execution may be discarded,
which implies its completion.

When cancellation is active for a \code{parallel}, \code{sections}, or loop region, each 
thread of the binding thread set resumes execution at the end of the canceled region if a 
cancellation point is encountered. If the canceled region is a \code{parallel} region, any 
tasks that have been created by a \code{task} construct and their descendent tasks are 
canceled according to the above \code{taskgroup} cancellation semantics. If the canceled 
region is a \code{sections}, or loop region, no task cancellation occurs.

\cppspecificstart
The usual C++ rules for object destruction are followed when cancellation is performed.
\cppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
All private objects or subobjects with \code{ALLOCATABLE} attribute that are allocated inside 
the canceled construct are deallocated.
\fortranspecificend

If the canceled construct contains a \code{reduction} or \code{lastprivate} clause, the final 
value of the \code{reduction} or \code{lastprivate} variable is undefined.

When an \code{if} clause is present on a \code{cancel} construct and the \code{if} expression evaluates 
to \plc{false}, the \code{cancel} construct does not activate cancellation. The cancellation point 
associated with the \code{cancel} construct is always encountered regardless of the value of 
the \code{if} expression.

\notestart
\noteheader -- The programmer is responsible for releasing locks and
other synchronization data structures that might cause a deadlock when
a \code{cancel} construct is encountered and blocked threads cannot be
canceled. The programmer is also responsible for ensuring proper
synchronizations to avoid deadlocks that might arise from cancellation
of OpenMP regions that contain OpenMP synchronization constructs.
\noteend

\events

The \plc{cancel} event occurs after a task encounters a 
\code{cancel} construct if the \plc{cancel-var} ICV is \plc{true}.

\tools

A thread dispatches a registered \code{ompt\_callback\_cancel}
callback for each occurrence of a \plc{cancel} event in that thread. 
The callback occurs in the context of the encountering task.  The callback has type signature
\code{ompt\_callback\_cancel\_t}. 
The callback receives \code{ompt\_cancel\_activated} as its \plc{flags} argument. 

\restrictions
The restrictions to the \code{cancel} construct are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item The behavior for concurrent cancellation of a region and a region nested within it is 
unspecified.

\item If \plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{taskgroup}, the \code{cancel}
construct must be closely nested inside a \code{task} construct and the
\code{cancel} region must be closely nested inside a \code{taskgroup} region. If
\plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{sections}, the \code{cancel} construct
must be closely nested inside a \code{sections} or \code{section} construct.
Otherwise, the \code{cancel} construct must be closely
nested inside an OpenMP construct that matches the type specified in
\plc{construct-type-clause} of the \code{cancel} construct.

\item A worksharing construct that is canceled must not have a \code{nowait} clause.

\item A loop construct that is canceled must not have an \code{ordered} clause.

\item During execution of a construct that may be subject to cancellation, a
thread must not encounter an orphaned cancellation point. That is, a
cancellation point must only be encountered within that construct and must
not be encountered elsewhere in its region.

\label{subsec:cancellation point Construct}
\index{cancellation constructs!cancellation point@{\code{cancellation}~\code{point}}}
\summary
The \code{cancellation}~\code{point} construct introduces a user-defined cancellation point at 
which implicit or explicit tasks check if cancellation of the innermost enclosing region 
of the type specified has been activated. The \code{cancellation}~\code{point} construct is a 
stand-alone directive.

\syntax
\ccppspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{cancellation}~\code{point} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
\#pragma omp cancellation point \plc{construct-type-clause new-line}
\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{construct-type-clause} is one of the following:

\begin{indentedcodelist}
parallel
sections
for
taskgroup
\end{indentedcodelist}
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{cancellation}~\code{point} construct is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
!\$omp cancellation point \plc{construct-type-clause}
\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{construct-type-clause} is one of the following:

\begin{indentedcodelist}
parallel
sections
do
taskgroup
\end{indentedcodelist}
\fortranspecificend

\binding
The binding thread set of the \code{cancellation point} construct is the current team.
The binding region of the \code{cancellation point} region is the innermost enclosing region of the type corresponding to the \plc{construct-type-clause} 
specified in the directive (that is, the innermost \code{parallel}, \code{sections}, loop, or 
\code{taskgroup} region).

\descr
This directive introduces a user-defined cancellation point at which an implicit or 
explicit task must check if cancellation of the innermost enclosing region of the type 
specified in the clause has been requested. This construct does not implement any 
synchronization between threads or tasks.

When an implicit or explicit task reaches a user-defined cancellation point and if 
the \plc{cancel-var} ICV is \plc{true}, then:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the \plc{construct-type-clause} of the encountered \code{cancellation
point} construct is \code{parallel}, \code{for}, \code{do}, or \code{sections},
the thread continues execution at the end of the canceled region if 
cancellation has been activated for the innermost enclosing region of 
the type specified.

\item If the \plc{construct-type-clause} of the encountered 
\code{cancellation point} construct is \code{taskgroup}, the encountering 
task checks for active cancellation of all  \plc{taskgroup sets} to which the 
encountering task belongs and continues execution at the end of the current 
task region if cancellation has been activated for any of them.
\end{itemize}


\events

The \plc{cancellation} event occurs if a task encounters a 
cancellation point and detected the activation of cancellation.

\tools

A thread dispatches a registered \code{ompt\_callback\_cancel}
callback for each occurrence of a \plc{cancellation} event in that thread. 
The callback occurs in the context of the encountering task.  The callback has type signature
\code{ompt\_callback\_cancel\_t}. 
The callback receives \code{ompt\_cancel\_detected} as its \plc{flags} argument. 

\restrictions
\begin{itemize}
\item A \code{cancellation}~\code{point} construct for which
\plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{taskgroup} must be closely nested
inside a \code{task} construct, and the \code{cancellation}~\code{point}
region must be closely nested inside a \code{taskgroup} region. A
\code{cancellation}~\code{point} construct for which
\plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{sections} must be closely nested
inside a \code{sections} or \code{section} construct. Otherwise, a
\code{cancellation}~\code{point} construct must be closely nested inside
an OpenMP construct that matches the type specified in
\plc{construct-type-clause}.

\section{Data Environment}
\label{sec:Data Environment}
\index{data environment}
This section presents a directive and several clauses for controlling the data environment 
during the execution of \code{teams}, \code{parallel}, \code{simd}, task generating, and worksharing regions.

\begin{itemize}
\item \specref{subsec:Data-sharing Attribute Rules} 
describes how the data-sharing attributes of variables
referenced in \code{teams}, \code{parallel}, \code{simd}, task generating, and worksharing regions are determined.

\item The \code{threadprivate} directive, which is provided to create threadprivate memory, 
is described in \specref{subsec:threadprivate Directive}.

\item Clauses that may be specified on directives to control the data-sharing attributes of 
variables referenced in \code{teams}, \code{parallel}, \code{simd}, task generating, or worksharing constructs are described in \specref{subsec:Data-Sharing Attribute Clauses}

\item Clauses that may be specified on directives to copy data values from private or 
threadprivate variables on one thread to the corresponding variables on other threads 
in the team are described in \specref{subsec:Data Copying Clauses}.

\item Clauses that may be specified on directives to control the data-mapping of variables to a device data environment are described in \specref{subsec:map Clause}.
\end{itemize}










\subsection{Data-sharing Attribute Rules}
\label{subsec:Data-sharing Attribute Rules}
\index{data-sharing attribute rules}
\index{attributes, data-sharing}
This section describes how the data-sharing attributes of variables referenced in 
\code{target}, \code{parallel}, \code{task}, \code{taskloop}, \code{simd}, and worksharing regions are determined. The following two cases are described separately:

\begin{itemize}
\item \specref{subsubsec:Data-sharing Attribute Rules for Variables Referenced in a Construct} 
describes the data-sharing attribute rules for variables 
referenced in a construct.

\item \specref{subsubsec:Data-sharing Attribute Rules for Variables Referenced in a Region but not in a Construct} describes the data-sharing attribute rules for variables 
referenced in a region, but outside any construct. 
\end{itemize}









\subsubsection{Data-sharing Attribute Rules for Variables Referenced in a Construct}
\label{subsubsec:Data-sharing Attribute Rules for Variables Referenced in a Construct}
The data-sharing attributes of variables that are referenced in a construct can be 
\emph{predetermined}, \emph{explicitly determined}, or \emph{implicitly determined}, according to the rules 
outlined in this section.

Specifying a variable on a \code{firstprivate}, \code{lastprivate}, \code{linear}, \code{reduction}, 
or \code{copyprivate} clause of an enclosed construct causes an implicit reference to the 
variable in the enclosing construct. Specifying a variable on a \code{map} clause of an enclosed 
construct may cause an implicit reference to the variable in the enclosing construct. 
Such implicit references are also subject to the data-sharing attribute rules outlined in 
this section.

Certain variables and objects have \emph{predetermined} data-sharing attributes as follows:

\ccppspecificstart
\begin{itemize}
\item Variables appearing in \code{threadprivate} directives are threadprivate.

\item Variables with automatic storage duration that are declared in a scope inside the 
construct are private. 

\item Objects with dynamic storage duration are shared.

\item Static data members are shared.

\item The loop iteration variable(s) in the associated \plc{for-loop(s)} of a
\code{for}, \code{parallel}~\code{for}, \code{taskloop}, or \code{distribute} construct is (are) private.

\item The loop iteration variable in the associated \plc{for-loop} of a \code{simd} construct with just 
one associated \plc{for-loop} is linear with a \plc{linear-step} that is the increment of
the associated \plc{for-loop}.

\item The loop iteration variables in the associated \plc{for-loops} of a \code{simd} construct with 
multiple associated \plc{for-loops} are lastprivate. 

\item Variables with static storage duration that are declared in a scope inside the construct 
are shared.

\item If an array section is a list item in a \code{map} clause on the \code{target} construct and the array section is derived from a variable for which the type is pointer then that variable is firstprivate. 
\end{itemize}
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
\begin{itemize}
\item Variables and common blocks appearing in \code{threadprivate} directives are 
threadprivate. 

\item The loop iteration variable(s) in the associated \plc{do-loop(s)} of a \code{do}, \code{parallel}~\code{do},
\code{taskloop}, or \code{distribute} construct is (are) private.

\item The loop iteration variable in the associated \plc{do-loop} of a \code{simd} construct with just 
one associated \plc{do-loop} is linear with a \plc{linear-step} that is the increment of
the associated \plc{do-loop}.

\item The loop iteration variables in the associated \plc{do-loops} of a \code{simd} construct with 
multiple associated \plc{do-loops} are lastprivate. 

\item A loop iteration variable for a sequential loop in a \code{parallel} or task generating construct is 
private in the innermost such construct that encloses the loop.

\item Implied-do indices and \code{forall} indices are private. 

\item Cray pointees have the same the data-sharing attribute as the storage with which their Cray 
pointers are associated.

\item Assumed-size arrays are shared.
\nopagebreak
\item An associate name preserves the association with the selector established at the 
\code{ASSOCIATE} statement.
\end{itemize}
\fortranspecificend

Variables with predetermined data-sharing attributes may not be listed in data-sharing 
attribute clauses, except for the cases listed below. For these exceptions only, listing a 
predetermined variable in a data-sharing attribute clause is allowed and overrides the 
variable's predetermined data-sharing attributes.

\ccppspecificstart
\begin{itemize}
\item The loop iteration variable(s) in the associated \plc{for-loop(s)} of a \code{for}, 
\code{parallel}~\code{for}, \code{taskloop}, or \code{distribute} construct may be listed in a \code{private} or \code{lastprivate} clause.

\item The loop iteration variable in the associated \plc{for-loop} of a \code{simd} construct with just 
one associated \plc{for-loop} may be listed in a \code{linear} clause with a
\plc{linear-step}
that is the increment of the associated \plc{for-loop}.

\item The loop iteration variables in the associated \plc{for-loops} of a \code{simd} construct with 
multiple associated \plc{for-loops} may be listed in a \code{lastprivate} clause. 

\item Variables with \code{const}-qualified type having no mutable member may be listed in a
\code{firstprivate} clause, even if they are static data members.
\end{itemize}
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
\begin{itemize}
\item The loop iteration variable(s) in the associated \plc{do-loop(s)} of a \code{do}, 
\code{parallel}~\code{do}, \code{taskloop}, or \code{distribute}
construct may be listed in a \code{private} or \code{lastprivate} clause. 

\item The loop iteration variable in the associated \plc{d}o-loop of a \code{simd} construct with just 
one associated \plc{do-loop} may be listed in a \code{linear} clause with a \plc{linear-step}
that is the increment of the associated loop.

\item The loop iteration variables in the associated \plc{do-loops} of a \code{simd} construct with 
multiple associated \plc{do-loops} may be listed in a \code{lastprivate} clause. 

\item Variables used as loop iteration variables in sequential loops in a \code{parallel} 
or task generating construct may be listed in data-sharing clauses on the construct itself, and on 
enclosed constructs, subject to other restrictions.

\item Assumed-size arrays may be listed in a \code{shared} clause.
\end{itemize}
\fortranspecificend

Additional restrictions on the variables that may appear in individual clauses are 
described with each clause in \specref{subsec:Data-Sharing Attribute Clauses}.

Variables with \emph{explicitly determined} data-sharing attributes are those that are referenced 
in a given construct and are listed in a data-sharing attribute clause on the construct.

Variables with \emph{implicitly determined} data-sharing attributes are those that are referenced 
in a given construct, do not have predetermined data-sharing attributes, and are not 
listed in a data-sharing attribute clause on the construct.

Rules for variables with \emph{implicitly determined} data-sharing attributes are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item In a \code{parallel}, \code{teams}, or task generating construct, the data-sharing attributes of these variables are
determined by the \code{default} clause, if present (see
\specref{subsubsec:default clause}).

\item In a \code{parallel} construct, if no \code{default} clause is present, these variables are 
shared.

\item For constructs other than task generating constructs, if no \code{default} clause is present, these variables reference the variables with the same names that exist in the enclosing context.

\item In a \code{target} construct, variables that are not mapped after applying data-mapping attribute rules (see \specref{subsec:Data-mapping Attribute Rules and Clauses}) are firstprivate.
\end{itemize}

\cppspecificstart
\begin{itemize}
\item In an orphaned task generating
construct, if no \code{default} clause is present, formal arguments passed by reference are firstprivate.
\end{itemize}
\cppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
\begin{itemize}
\item In an orphaned task generating
construct, if no \code{default} clause is present, dummy arguments 
are firstprivate.
\end{itemize}
\fortranspecificend

\begin{itemize}
\item In a task generating construct, if no \code{default} clause is present, a variable
for which the data-sharing attribute is not determined by the rules above
and that in the enclosing context is determined to be shared by all implicit tasks bound
to the current team is shared.

\item In a task generating construct, if no
\code{default} clause is present, a variable for which the data-sharing 
attribute is not determined by the rules above is firstprivate.
\end{itemize}

Additional restrictions on the variables for which data-sharing attributes cannot be 
implicitly determined in a task generating construct are described in
\specref{subsubsec:firstprivate clause}.

\subsubsection{Data-sharing Attribute Rules for Variables Referenced in a Region but not in a Construct}
\label{subsubsec:Data-sharing Attribute Rules for Variables Referenced in a Region but not in a Construct}
The data-sharing attributes of variables that are referenced in a region, but not in a 
construct, are determined as follows: 

\ccppspecificstart
\begin{itemize}
\item Variables with static storage duration that are declared in called routines in the region 
are shared.

\item File-scope or namespace-scope variables referenced in called routines in the region 
are shared unless they appear in a \code{threadprivate} directive.

\item Objects with dynamic storage duration are shared.

\item Static data members are shared unless they appear in a \code{threadprivate} directive.

\item In C++, formal arguments of called routines in the region that are passed by reference have the same data-sharing attributes as the associated actual arguments. 

\item Other variables declared in called routines in the region are private.
\end{itemize}
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
\begin{itemize}
\item Local variables declared in called routines in the region and that have the \code{save} 
attribute, or that are data initialized, are shared unless they appear in a 
\code{threadprivate} directive.

\item Variables belonging to common blocks, or accessed by host or use association, and referenced in called routines in the region are shared unless they appear in a \code{threadprivate} directive. 

\item Dummy arguments of called routines in the region that have the
    \code{VALUE} attribute are private.

\item Dummy arguments of called routines in the region that do not have the
    \code{VALUE} attribute are private if the associated actual argument is not
    shared.

\item Dummy arguments of called routines in the region that do not have the
\code{VALUE} attribute are shared if the actual argument is shared and it
is a scalar variable, structure, an array that is not a pointer or
assumed-shape array, or a simply contiguous array section.  Otherwise, the
data-sharing attribute of the dummy argument is implementation-defined if
the associated actual argument is shared.

\item Cray pointees have the same data-sharing attribute as the storage with which their Cray pointers are associated.

\item Implied-do indices, \code{forall} indices, and other local variables declared in called 
routines in the region are private.

\label{subsec:threadprivate Directive}
\summary
The \code{threadprivate} directive specifies that variables are replicated, with each thread 
having its own copy. The \code{threadprivate} directive is a declarative directive.
\syntax
\ccppspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{threadprivate} directive is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
\#pragma omp threadprivate(\plc{list}) \plc{new-line}
\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{list} is a comma-separated list of file-scope, namespace-scope, or static 
block-scope variables that do not have incomplete types.
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{threadprivate} directive is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
!\$omp threadprivate(\plc{list})
\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{list} is a comma-separated list of named variables and named common blocks. 
Common block names must appear between slashes.
\fortranspecificend

\descr
Each copy of a threadprivate variable is initialized once, in the manner specified by the 
program, but at an unspecified point in the program prior to the first reference to that 
copy. The storage of all copies of a threadprivate variable is freed according to how 
static variables are handled in the base language, but at an unspecified point in the 
program.

A program in which a thread references another thread’s copy of a threadprivate variable 
is non-conforming.

The content of a threadprivate variable can change across a task scheduling point if the 
executing thread switches to another task that modifies the variable. For more details on 
task scheduling, see 
\specref{sec:Execution Model} and 
\specref{sec:Tasking Constructs}.

In \code{parallel} regions, references by the master thread will be to the copy of the 
variable in the thread that encountered the \code{parallel} region. 

During a sequential part references will be to the initial thread’s copy of the variable. 
The values of data in the initial thread’s copy of a threadprivate variable are guaranteed 
to persist between any two consecutive references to the variable in the program. 

The values of data in the threadprivate variables of non-initial threads 
are guaranteed to persist between two consecutive active \code{parallel} 
regions only if all of the following conditions hold:

\begin{itemize}  % L0 vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
\item Neither \code{parallel} region is nested inside another explicit \code{parallel} region. 

\item The number of threads used to execute both \code{parallel} regions is the same. 

\item The thread affinity policies used to execute both \code{parallel} regions are the same. 

\item The value of the \plc{dyn-var} internal control variable in the enclosing task region is \plc{false} 
at entry to both \code{parallel} regions.
\end{itemize} % L0 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If these conditions all hold, and if a threadprivate variable is referenced in both regions, 
then threads with the same thread number in their respective regions will reference the 
same copy of that variable.

\ccppspecificstart
If the above conditions hold, the storage duration, lifetime, and value of a thread’s copy 
of a threadprivate variable that does not appear in any \code{copyin} clause on the second 
region will be retained. Otherwise, the storage duration, lifetime, and value of a thread’s 
copy of the variable in the second region is unspecified.

If the value of a variable referenced in an explicit initializer of a threadprivate variable 
is modified prior to the first reference to any instance of the threadprivate variable, then 
the behavior is unspecified. 
\ccppspecificend

\cppspecificstart
The order in which any constructors for different threadprivate variables of class type 
are called is unspecified. The order in which any destructors for different threadprivate 
variables of class type are called is unspecified. 
\cppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
A variable is affected by a \code{copyin} clause if the variable appears in the \code{copyin} clause 
or it is in a common block that appears in the \code{copyin} clause. 

If the above conditions hold, the definition, association, or allocation status of a thread’s 
copy of a threadprivate variable or a variable in a threadprivate common 
block, that is not affected by any \code{copyin} clause that appears on the second region, will 
be retained. Otherwise, the definition and association status of a thread’s copy of the 
variable in the second region are undefined, and the allocation status of an allocatable 
variable will be implementation defined. 

If a threadprivate variable or a variable in a threadprivate common block is 
not affected by any \code{copyin} clause that appears on the first \code{parallel} region in which 
it is referenced, the variable or any subobject of the variable is initially defined or 
undefined according to the following rules:

\begin{itemize} % L0 vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
\item If it has the \code{ALLOCATABLE} attribute, each copy created will have an initial 
allocation status of unallocated.

\item If it has the \code{POINTER} attribute:
\begin{itemize} % L1 vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
\item if it has an initial association status of disassociated, either through explicit 
initialization or default initialization, each copy created will have an association 
status of disassociated;
\item otherwise, each copy created will have an association status of undefined.
\end{itemize} % l1 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

\item If it does not have either the \code{POINTER} or the \code{ALLOCATABLE} attribute:

\begin{samepage}\begin{itemize} %L1 vvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
\item if it is initially defined, either through explicit initialization or default 
initialization, each copy created is so defined;

\item otherwise, each copy created is undefined.
\end{itemize} % L1 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
\end{samepage}

\end{itemize} % L0 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
\fortranspecificend

\restrictions
The restrictions to the \code{threadprivate} directive are as follows:

\begin{itemize} % L0 vvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
\item A threadprivate variable must not appear in any clause except the \code{copyin}, 
\code{copyprivate}, \code{schedule}, \code{num\_threads}, \code{thread\_limit}, and \code{if} clauses.

\item A program in which an untied task accesses threadprivate storage is non-conforming.

\ccppspecificstart
\item A variable that is part of another variable (as an array or structure element) cannot 
appear in a \code{threadprivate} clause unless it is a static data member of a C++ 
class.

\item A \code{threadprivate} directive for file-scope variables must appear outside any 
definition or declaration, and must lexically precede all references to any of the 
variables in its list.

\item A \code{threadprivate} directive for namespace-scope variables must appear outside 
any definition or declaration other than the namespace definition itself, and must 
lexically precede all references to any of the variables in its list.

\item Each variable in the list of a \code{threadprivate} directive at file, namespace, or class 
scope must refer to a variable declaration at file, namespace, or class scope that 
lexically precedes the directive.

\item A \code{threadprivate} directive for static block-scope variables must appear in the 
scope of the variable and not in a nested scope. The directive must lexically precede 
all references to any of the variables in its list.

\item Each variable in the list of a \code{threadprivate} directive in block scope must refer to 
a variable declaration in the same scope that lexically precedes the directive. The 
variable declaration must use the static storage-class specifier.

\item If a variable is specified in a \code{threadprivate} directive in one translation unit, it 
must be specified in a \code{threadprivate} directive in every translation unit in which 
it is declared.

\item The address of a threadprivate variable is not an address constant.
\ccppspecificend

\cppspecificstart
\item A \code{threadprivate} directive for static class member variables must appear in the 
class definition, in the same scope in which the member variables are declared, and 
must lexically precede all references to any of the variables in its list.

\item A threadprivate variable must not have an incomplete type or a reference type.

\item A threadprivate variable with class type must have:

\begin{itemize} % L1 vvvvvvvvvvvvvv
\item an accessible, unambiguous default constructor in case of default initialization 
without a given initializer;

\item an accessible, unambiguous constructor accepting the given argument in case of 
direct initialization;

\item an accessible, unambiguous copy constructor in case of copy initialization with an 
explicit initializer
\end{itemize} % L1 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
\cppspecificend

\end{itemize} % L0 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

\fortranspecificstart
\begin{itemize} % L0 vvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
\item A variable that is part of another variable (as an array or structure element) cannot 
appear in a \code{threadprivate} clause.

\item The \code{threadprivate} directive must appear in the declaration section of a scoping 
unit in which the common block or variable is declared. Although variables in 
common blocks can be accessed by use association or host association, common 
block names cannot. This means that a common block name specified in a 
\code{threadprivate} directive must be declared to be a common block in the same 
scoping unit in which the \code{threadprivate} directive appears. 

\item If a \code{threadprivate} directive specifying a common block name appears in one 
program unit, then such a directive must also appear in every other program unit that 
contains a \code{COMMON} statement specifying the same name. It must appear after the last 
such \code{COMMON} statement in the program unit.

\item If a threadprivate variable or a threadprivate common block is declared 
with the \code{BIND} attribute, the corresponding C entities must also be specified in a 
\code{threadprivate} directive in the C program.

\item A blank common block cannot appear in a \code{threadprivate} directive.

\item A variable can only appear in a \code{threadprivate} directive in the scope in which it 
is declared. It must not be an element of a common block or appear in an 
\code{EQUIVALENCE} statement.

\item A variable that appears in a \code{threadprivate} directive must be declared in the 
scope of a module or have the \code{SAVE} attribute, either explicitly or implicitly.

\subsection{Data-Sharing Attribute Clauses}
\label{subsec:Data-Sharing Attribute Clauses}
\index{data-sharing attribute clauses}
\index{attribute clauses}
\index{clauses!data-sharing}
\index{clauses!attribute data-sharing}
Several constructs accept clauses that allow a user to control the data-sharing attributes 
of variables referenced in the construct. Data-sharing attribute clauses apply only to 
variables for which the names are visible in the construct on which the clause appears.

Not all of the clauses listed in this section are valid on all directives. The set of clauses 
that is valid on a particular directive is described with the directive.

Most of the clauses accept a comma-separated list of list items (see 
\specref{sec:Directive Format}). 
All list items appearing in a clause must be visible, according to the scoping rules 
of the base language. With the exception of the \code{default} clause, clauses may be 
repeated as needed. A list item that specifies a given variable may not appear in more 
than one clause on the same directive, except that a variable may be specified in both 
\code{firstprivate} and \code{lastprivate} clauses.

The reduction data-sharing clauses are explained in Section \ref{subsec:Reduction Clauses}.

\cppspecificstart
If a variable referenced in a data-sharing attribute clause has a type derived from a 
template, and there are no other references to that variable in the program, then any 
behavior related to that variable is unspecified. 
\cppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
When a named common block appears in a \code{private}, \code{firstprivate}, 
\code{lastprivate}, or \code{shared} clause of a directive, none of its members may be declared 
in another data-sharing attribute clause in that directive. When individual members of a common block appear in a \code{private}, \code{firstprivate}, 
\code{lastprivate}, \code{reduction}, or \code{linear} clause of a directive, the storage of the specified variables is no longer Fortran associated with the storage of the common block itself.
\fortranspecificend










\subsubsection{\code{default} Clause}
\label{subsubsec:default clause}
\index{default@{\code{default}}}
\index{clauses!default@{\code{default}}}
\summary
The \code{default} clause explicitly determines the data-sharing attributes of variables that 
are referenced in a \code{parallel}, \code{teams}, or task generating construct
and would otherwise be implicitly determined (see
\specref{subsubsec:Data-sharing Attribute Rules for Variables Referenced in a Construct}).

\syntax
\ccppspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{default} clause is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
default(shared \textnormal{|} none)
\end{boxedcode}
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
The syntax of the \code{default} clause is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
default(private \textnormal{|} firstprivate \textnormal{|} shared \textnormal{|} none)
\end{boxedcode}
\fortranspecificend

\descr
The \code{default(shared)} clause causes all variables referenced in the construct that 
have implicitly determined data-sharing attributes to be shared.

\fortranspecificstart
The \code{default(firstprivate)} clause causes all variables in the construct that have 
implicitly determined data-sharing attributes to be firstprivate.

The \code{default(private)} clause causes all variables referenced in the construct that 
have implicitly determined data-sharing attributes to be private.
\fortranspecificend

The \code{default(none)} clause requires that each variable that is referenced in the 
construct, and that does not have a predetermined data-sharing attribute, must have its 
data-sharing attribute explicitly determined by being listed in a data-sharing attribute 
clause. 

\restrictions
The restrictions to the \code{default} clause are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Only a single \code{default} clause may be specified on a 
\code{parallel}, \code{task}, \code{taskloop} or \code{teams} directive.
\end{itemize}









\subsubsection{\code{shared} Clause}
\label{subsubsec:shared clause}
\index{shared@{\code{shared}}}
\index{clauses!shared@{\code{shared}}}
\summary
The \code{shared} clause declares one or more list items to be shared by tasks generated by 
a \code{parallel}, \code{teams}, or task generating construct.

\syntax
The syntax of the \code{shared} clause is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
shared(\plc{list})
\end{boxedcode}

\descr
All references to a list item within a task refer to the storage area of the original variable 
at the point the directive was encountered. 

The programmer must ensure, by adding proper synchronization, that 
storage shared by an explicit task region does not reach the end of its lifetime before 
the explicit task region completes its execution. 


\fortranspecificstart
The association status of a shared pointer becomes undefined upon entry to and on exit 
from the \code{parallel}, \code{teams}, or task generating construct if it
is associated with a target or a  subobject of a target that is in a \code{private},
\code{firstprivate}, \code{lastprivate}, or \code{reduction} clause in the construct.


\notestart
\noteheader -- Passing a shared variable to a procedure may result in the use of
temporary storage in place of the actual argument when the corresponding dummy
argument does not have the \code{VALUE} attribute and its data-sharing attribute
is implementation-defined as per the rules in
\specref{subsubsec:Data-sharing Attribute Rules for Variables Referenced in a Region but not in a Construct}.  
These conditions effectively result in references to, and definitions of, the
temporary storage during the procedure reference.  Furthermore, the value of
the shared variable is copied into the intervening temporary storage before the procedure
reference when the dummy argument does not have the \code{INTENT(OUT)}
attribute, and back out of the temporary storage into the shared variable when
the dummy argument does not have the \code{INTENT(IN)} attribute.  Any
references to (or definitions of) the shared storage that is associated with
the dummy argument by any other task must be synchronized with
the procedure reference to avoid possible race conditions.

\noteend
\medskip
\fortranspecificend


\restrictions
The restrictions for the \code{shared} clause are as follows:
\begin{itemize}

\cspecificstart
\item A variable that is part of another variable (as an array or structure element) cannot appear in a shared clause.
\cspecificend

\cppspecificstart
\item A variable that is part of another variable (as an array or structure
  element) cannot appear in a \code{shared} clause except if the \code{shared}
  clause is associated with a construct within a class non-static member
  function and the variable is an accessible data member of the object for
  which the non-static member function is invoked.
\cppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
\item A variable that is part of another variable (as an array or structure element) cannot appear in a shared clause.
\fortranspecificend

\end{itemize}







\subsubsection{\code{private} Clause}
\index{private@{\code{private}}}
\index{clauses!private@{\code{private}}}
\label{subsubsec:private clause}
\summary
The \code{private} clause declares one or more list items to be private to a task or to a 
SIMD lane.

\syntax
The syntax of the private clause is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
private(\plc{list})
\end{boxedcode}

\descr
Each task that references a list item that appears in a \code{private} clause in any statement 
in the construct receives a new list item. Each SIMD lane used in a \code{simd} construct that 
references a list item that appears in a private clause in any statement in the construct 
receives a new list item. Language-specific attributes for new list items are derived from 
the corresponding original list item. Inside the construct, all references to the original 
list item are replaced by references to the new list item. In the rest of the region, it is 
unspecified whether references are to the new list item or the original list item. 

\cppspecificstart
If the construct is contained in a member function, it is unspecified anywhere in the region if accesses through the implicit \code{this} pointer refer to the new list item or the original list item.
\cppspecificend

Therefore, if an attempt is made to reference the original item, its value after the region 
is also unspecified. If a SIMD construct or a task does not reference a list item that 
appears in a \code{private} clause, it is unspecified whether SIMD lanes or the task receive 
a new list item. 

The value and/or allocation status of the original list item will change only: 

\begin{itemize}
\item if accessed and modified via pointer, 

\item if possibly accessed in the region but outside of the construct, 

\item as a side effect of directives or clauses, or

\newpage %% HACK
\fortranspecificstart
\item if accessed and modified via construct association.
\fortranspecificend
\end{itemize}

List items that appear in a \code{private}, \code{firstprivate}, or
\code{reduction} clause in a \code{parallel} construct may also appear
in a \code{private} clause in an enclosed \code{parallel},
worksharing, \code{task}, \code{taskloop}, \code{simd}, or
\code{target} construct.

List items that appear in a \code{private} or \code{firstprivate}
clause in a \code{task} or \code{taskloop} construct may also appear in a \code{private}
clause in an enclosed \code{parallel}, \code{task}, \code{taskloop}, \code{simd}, or
\code{target} construct.

List items that appear in a \code{private}, \code{firstprivate},
\code{lastprivate}, or \code{reduction} clause in a worksharing
construct may also appear in a \code{private} clause in an enclosed
\code{parallel}, \code{task}, \code{simd}, or \code{target} construct.

\ccppspecificstart
A new list item of the same type, with automatic storage duration, is allocated for the 
construct. The storage and thus lifetime of these list items lasts until the block in which 
they are created exits. The size and alignment of the new list item are determined by the 
type of the variable. This allocation occurs once for each task generated by the construct 
and once for each SIMD lane used by the construct.

The new list item is initialized, or has an undefined initial value, as if it had been locally 
declared without an initializer. 
\ccppspecificend

\cppspecificstart
If the type of a list item is a reference to a type \plc{T} then the type will be considered to be 
\plc{T} for all purposes of this clause.

The order in which any default constructors for different private variables of class type 
are called is unspecified. The order in which any destructors for different private 
variables of class type are called is unspecified.
\cppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart 
If any statement of the construct references a list item, a new list
item of the same type and type parameters is allocated. This
allocation occurs once for each task generated by the construct and
once for each SIMD lane used by the construct. The initial value of
the new list item is undefined. The initial status of a private
pointer is undefined.

For a list item or the subobject of a list item with the \code{ALLOCATABLE} attribute:

\begin{itemize}
\item if the allocation status is unallocated, the new list item or the subobject
of the new list item will have an initial allocation status of unallocated.

\item if the allocation status is allocated, the new list item or the subobject of
the new list item will have an initial allocation status of allocated.

\item If the new list item or the subobject of the new list item is an array, its bounds will be 
the same as those of the original list item or the subobject of the original list item.
\end{itemize}

A list item that appears in a \code{private} clause may be storage-associated with other 
variables when the \code{private} clause is encountered. Storage association may exist 
because of constructs such as \code{EQUIVALENCE} or \code{COMMON}. If \plc{A} is a variable appearing 
in a \code{private} clause on a construct and \plc{B} is a variable that is storage-associated with \plc{A}, then:

\begin{itemize}
\item The contents, allocation, and association status of \plc{B} are undefined on entry to the region.

\item Any definition of \plc{A}, or of its allocation or association status, causes the contents, 
allocation, and association status of \plc{B} to become undefined. 

\item Any definition of \plc{B}, or of its allocation or association status, causes the contents, 
allocation, and association status of \plc{A} to become undefined. 
\end{itemize}

A list item that appears in a \code{private} clause may be a selector of an \code{ASSOCIATE} 
construct. If the construct association is established prior to a \code{parallel} region, the 
association between the associate name and the original list item will be retained in the 
region.

Finalization of a list item of a finalizable type or subojects of a
list item of a finalizable type occurs at the end of the region. The
order in which any final subroutines for different variables of a
finalizable type are called is unspecified.
\fortranspecificend

\restrictions
The restrictions to the \code{private} clause are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\cspecificstart
\item A variable that is part of another variable (as an array or structure element) cannot 
appear in a \code{private} clause.
\cspecificend

\cppspecificstart
\item A variable that is part of another variable (as an array or structure element) cannot 
appear in a \code{private} clause except if the \code{private} clause is associated with a construct within a class non-static member function and the variable is an accessible data member of the object for which the non-static member function is invoked.

\item A variable of class type (or array thereof) that appears in a \code{private} clause requires 
an accessible, unambiguous default constructor for the class type. 
\cppspecificend

\ccppspecificstart
\item A variable that appears in a \code{private} clause must not have a \code{const}-qualified type 
unless it is of class type with a \code{mutable} member. This restriction does not apply to 
the \code{firstprivate} clause.

\item A variable that appears in a \code{private} clause must not have an incomplete type or be a reference to an incomplete type.
\ccppspecificend


\fortranspecificstart
\item A variable that is part of another variable (as an array or structure element) cannot

\item Variables that appear in namelist statements, in variable format expressions, and in 
expressions for statement function definitions, may not appear in a \code{private} clause.

\item Pointers with the \code{INTENT(IN)} attribute may not appear in a \code{private} clause. This 
restriction does not apply to the \code{firstprivate} clause.

\end{itemize}










\subsubsection{\code{firstprivate} Clause}
\label{subsubsec:firstprivate clause}
\index{firstprivate@{\code{firstprivate}}}
\index{clauses!firstprivate@{\code{firstprivate}}}
\summary
The \code{firstprivate} clause declares one or more list items to be private to a task, and 
initializes each of them with the value that the corresponding original item has when the 
construct is encountered. 

\syntax
The syntax of the \code{firstprivate} clause is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
firstprivate(\plc{list})
\end{boxedcode}

\descr
The \code{firstprivate} clause provides a superset of the functionality provided by the 
\code{private} clause. 

A list item that appears in a \code{firstprivate} clause is subject to the \code{private} clause 
semantics described in 
\specref{subsubsec:private clause}, 
except as noted. In addition, the 
new list item is initialized from the original list item existing before the construct. The 
initialization of the new list item is done once for each task that references the list item 
in any statement in the construct. The initialization is done prior to the execution of the 
construct.

For a \code{firstprivate} clause on a \code{parallel}, \code{task},
\code{taskloop}, \code{target}, or \code{teams} construct, the
initial value of the new list item is the value of the original list
item that exists immediately prior to the construct in the task region
where the construct is encountered. For a \code{firstprivate} clause
on a worksharing construct, the initial value of the new list item for
each implicit task of the threads that execute the worksharing
construct is the value of the original list item that exists in the
implicit task immediately prior to the point in time that the
worksharing construct is encountered.

To avoid race conditions, concurrent updates of the original list item must be 
synchronized with the read of the original list item that occurs as a result of the 
\code{firstprivate} clause.

If a list item appears in both \code{firstprivate} and \code{lastprivate} clauses, the update 
required for \code{lastprivate} occurs after all the initializations for \code{firstprivate}.

\ccppspecificstart
For variables of non-array type, the initialization occurs by copy assignment. For an 
array of elements of non-array type, each element is initialized as if by assignment from 
an element of the original array to the corresponding element of the new array. 
\ccppspecificend

\cppspecificstart
For variables of class type, a copy constructor is invoked to perform the initialization. 
The order in which copy constructors for different variables of class type are called is 
unspecified. 
\cppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
If the original list item does not have the \code{POINTER} attribute, initialization of the new 
list items occurs as if by intrinsic assignment, unless the original list item has the 
allocation status of unallocated, in which case the new list items will have the
same status.

If the original list item has the \code{POINTER} attribute, the new list items receive the same 
association status of the original list item as if by pointer assignment.
\fortranspecificend

\restrictions
The restrictions to the \code{firstprivate} clause are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item A list item that is private within a \code{parallel} region must
not appear in a \code{firstprivate} clause on a worksharing construct
if any of the worksharing regions arising
from the worksharing construct ever bind to any of the
\code{parallel} regions arising from the \code{parallel} construct.

\item A list item that is private within a \code{teams} region must not appear in a 
\code{firstprivate} clause on a \code{distribute} construct if any of the \code{distribute} 
regions arising from the \code{distribute} construct ever bind to any of the \code{teams} 
regions arising from the \code{teams} construct.

\item A list item that appears in a \code{reduction} clause of a \code{parallel} 
construct must not appear in a \code{firstprivate} clause on a worksharing, \code{task}, 
or \code{taskloop} construct if any of the worksharing or task regions arising from 
the worksharing, \code{task}, or \code{taskloop} construct ever bind to any of the 
\code{parallel} regions arising from the \code{parallel} construct.

\item A list item that appears in a \code{reduction} clause of a \code{teams} construct must not 
appear in a \code{firstprivate} clause on a \code{distribute} construct if any of the 
\code{distribute} regions arising from the \code{distribute} construct ever bind to any of 
the \code{teams} regions arising from the \code{teams} construct. 

\item A list item that appears in a \code{reduction} clause of a worksharing construct must not 
appear in a \code{firstprivate} clause in a \code{task} construct encountered during execution 
of any of the worksharing regions arising from the worksharing construct.

\cppspecificstart
\item A variable of class type (or array thereof) that appears in a \code{firstprivate} clause 
requires an accessible, unambiguous copy constructor for the class type.
\cppspecificend

\ccppspecificstart

\subsubsection{\code{lastprivate} Clause}
\index{lastprivate@{\code{lastprivate}}}
\index{clauses!lastprivate@{\code{lastprivate}}}
\label{subsubsec:lastprivate clause}
\summary
The \code{lastprivate} clause declares one or more list items to be private to an implicit 
task or to a SIMD lane, and causes the corresponding original list item to be updated 
after the end of the region. 

\syntax
The syntax of the \code{lastprivate} clause is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
lastprivate(\plc{[ lastprivate-modifier}:\plc{] list})
\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{lastprivate-modifier} is:
\begin{indentedcodelist}
conditional
\end{indentedcodelist}

\descr
The \code{lastprivate} clause provides a superset of the functionality provided by the 
\code{private} clause.

A list item that appears in a \code{lastprivate} clause is subject to the \code{private} clause 
semantics described in 
\specref{subsubsec:private clause}. 
In addition, when a 
\code{lastprivate} clause without the \code{conditional} modifier appears on the directive that identifies a worksharing construct 
or a SIMD construct, the value of each new list item from the sequentially last iteration 
of the associated loops, or the lexically last \code{section} construct, is assigned to the 
original list item. When the \code{conditional} modifier appears on the clause,
if an assignment to a list item is encountered in the construct then the
original list item is assigned the value that is assigned to the new list item
in the sequentially last iteration or lexically last section in which such an
assignment is encountered.


\ccppspecificstart
For an array of elements of non-array type, each element is assigned to the 
corresponding element of the original array.
\ccppspecificend
\bigskip

\fortranspecificstart
If the original list item does not have the \code{POINTER} attribute, its update occurs as if by 
intrinsic assignment.

If the original list item has the \code{POINTER} attribute, its update occurs as if by pointer 
assignment.
\fortranspecificend

When the \code{conditional} modifier does not appear on the \code{lastprivate} clause, list items that are not
assigned a value by the sequentially last iteration of the loops, or by the
lexically last \code{section} construct, have unspecified values after the
construct.  Unassigned subcomponents also have unspecified values after the
construct.

The original list item becomes defined at the end of the construct if there is an implicit 
barrier at that point. To avoid race conditions, concurrent reads or updates of the original 
list item must be synchronized with the update of the original list item that occurs as a 
result of the \code{lastprivate} clause.

If the \code{lastprivate} clause is used on a construct that does not end with
an implicit barrier, accesses to the original list item may create a data race.
To avoid this, if an assignment to the original list item occurs
then synchronization must be inserted to ensure that the assignment completes and
the original list item is flushed to memory.

If a list item appears in both \code{firstprivate} and \code{lastprivate} clauses, the update 
required for \code{lastprivate} occurs after all initializations for \code{firstprivate}.

\restrictions
The restrictions to the \code{lastprivate} clause are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item A list item that is private within a \code{parallel} region, or
that appears in the \code{reduction} clause of a \code{parallel}
construct, must not appear in a \code{lastprivate} clause on a
worksharing construct if any of the corresponding
worksharing regions ever binds to any of the corresponding
\code{parallel} regions.

\item If a list item that appears in a \code{lastprivate} clause with the
\code{conditional} modifier is modified in the region by an assignment
outside the construct or not to the list item then the value assigned to
the original list item is unspecified.

\item A list item that appears in a \code{lastprivate} clause with the
\code{conditional} modifier must be a scalar variable.

\cppspecificstart
\item A variable of class type (or array thereof) that appears in a \code{lastprivate} clause 
requires an accessible, unambiguous default constructor for the class type, unless the 
list item is also specified in a \code{firstprivate} clause. 

\item A variable of class type (or array thereof) that appears in a \code{lastprivate} clause 
requires an accessible, unambiguous copy assignment operator for the class type. The 
order in which copy assignment operators for different variables of class type are 
called is unspecified.
\cppspecificend

\ccppspecificstart
\item A variable that appears in a \code{lastprivate} clause must not have a \code{const}-qualified 
type unless it is of class type with a \code{mutable} member. 

\item A variable that appears in a \code{lastprivate} clause must not have an incomplete C/C++ type or be a reference to an incomplete type.

\item If a list item in a \code{lastprivate} clause on a worksharing
construct has a reference type then it must bind to the same object for all threads of the team.
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
\item A variable that appears in a \code{lastprivate} clause must be definable.

\item If the original list item has the \code{ALLOCATABLE} attribute, the
    corresponding list item whose value is assigned to the original list item must have an allocation status of allocated upon exit from
    the sequentially last iteration or lexically last \code{section} construct.

\item Variables that appear in namelist statements, in variable format expressions, or in 
expressions for statement function definitions, may not appear in a \code{lastprivate} 
clause.

\descr
The \code{linear} clause provides a superset of the functionality provided by the \code{private} clause.
A list item that appears in a \code{linear} clause is subject to the \code{private} clause semantics described
in \specref{subsubsec:private clause} except as noted.
If \plc{linear-step} is not specified, it is assumed to be 1.

When a \code{linear} clause is specified on a construct, the value of the new list item on each iteration of the associated loop(s) corresponds to the value of the original list item before entering the construct plus the logical number of the iteration times \plc{linear-step}. 
The value corresponding to the sequentially last iteration of the associated loop(s) is assigned to the original list item.

When a \code{linear} clause is specified on a declarative directive, all list items must be formal parameters (or, in Fortran, dummy arguments) of a function that will be invoked concurrently on each SIMD lane.
If no \plc{modifier} is specified or the \code{val} or \code{uval} modifier is specified, the value of each list item on each lane corresponds to the value of the list item upon entry to the function plus the logical number of the lane times \plc{linear-step}.
If the \code{uval} modifier is specified, each invocation uses the same storage location for each SIMD lane; this storage location is updated with the final value of the logically last lane.
If the \code{ref} modifier is specified, the storage location of each list item on each lane corresponds to an array at the storage location upon entry to the function indexed by the logical number of the lane times \plc{linear-step}.


\restrictions
\begin{itemize}
\item The \plc{linear-step} expression must be invariant during the execution of the region 
associated with the construct. Otherwise, the execution results in unspecified 
behavior.

\item A \plc{list-item} cannot appear in more than one \code{linear} clause.

\item A \plc{list-item} that appears in a \code{linear} clause cannot appear in any other data-sharing 
attribute clause. 

\cspecificstart
\item A \plc{list-item} that appears in a \code{linear} clause must be of integral or pointer type.
\cspecificend

\cppspecificstart
\item A \plc{list-item} that appears in a \code{linear} clause without the \code{ref} modifier must be of integral or pointer type, or must be a reference to an integral or pointer type. 
\item The \code{ref} or \code{uval} modifier can only be used if the \plc{list-item} is of a reference type.
\item If a list item in a \code{linear} clause on a worksharing
construct has a reference type then it must bind to the same object for all threads of the team.
\item If the list item is of a reference type and the \code{ref} modifier is not specified and if any write to the list item occurs before any read of the list item then the result is unspecified.
\cppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
\item A \plc{list-item} that appears in a \code{linear} clause without the \code{ref} modifier must be of type \code{integer}.
\item The \code{ref} or \code{uval} modifier can only be used if the \plc{list-item} is a dummy argument without the \code{VALUE} attribute.
\item Variables that have the \code{POINTER} attribute and Cray pointers may not appear in a linear clause. 
\item The list item with the \code{ALLOCATABLE} attribute in the sequentially last iteration must have an allocation status of allocated upon exit from that iteration. 
\item If the list item is a dummy argument without the \code{VALUE} attribute and the \code{ref} modifier is not specified and if any write to the list item occurs before any read of the list item then the result is unspecified.

\subsection{Reduction Clauses}
\index{reduction clauses}
\label{subsec:Reduction Clauses}
The reduction clauses can be used to perform some forms of recurrence
calculations (involving mathematically associative and commutative operators)
in parallel.

Reduction clauses include reduction scoping clauses and reduction participating
clauses. Reduction scoping clauses define the region in which a reduction is
computed. Reduction participating clauses define the participants in the
reduction.

Reduction clauses specify a \plc{reduction-identifier} and one or more list
items.

\fortranspecificend
\vspace{\baselineskip}

In the above tables, \code{omp\_in} and \code{omp\_out} correspond to two
identifiers that refer to storage of the type of the list item. \code{omp\_out}
holds the final value of the combiner operation.

Any \plc{reduction-identifier} that is defined with the \code{declare}~\code{reduction}
directive is also valid. In that case, the initializer and combiner of the
\plc{reduction-identifier} are specified by the \plc{initializer-clause} and
the \plc{combiner} in the \code{declare}~\code{reduction} directive.




\descr
A reduction clause specifies a \plc{reduction-identifier} and one or more list
items.

The \plc{reduction-identifier} specified in a reduction clause must match a
previously declared \plc{reduction-identifier} of the same name and type for
each of the list items. This match is done by means of a name lookup in the
base language.

The list items that appear in a reduction clause may include array sections.


\cppspecificstart
If the type is a derived class, then any \plc{reduction-identifier} that
matches its base classes is also a match, if there is no specific match for the
type.

If the \plc{reduction-identifier} is not an \plc{id-expression}, then it is
implicitly converted to one by prepending the keyword operator (for example,
\code{+} becomes \code{\plc{operator}+}).

If the \plc{reduction-identifier} is qualified then a qualified name lookup is
used to find the declaration.

If the \plc{reduction-identifier} is unqualified then an \emph{argument-dependent name lookup}
must be performed using the type of each list item.
\cppspecificend

If the list item is an array or array section, it will be treated as
if a reduction clause would be applied to each separate element
of the array section. 



\restrictions
The restrictions common to reduction clauses are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Any number of reduction clauses can be specified on the directive, but a
list item (or any array element in an array section) can appear only once in
reduction clauses for that directive.

\item For a \plc{reduction-identifier} declared with the \code{declare}~\code{reduction}
construct, the directive must appear before its use in a reduction clause.

\item If a list item is an array section, it must specify contiguous storage
and it cannot be a zero-length array section.

\item If a list item is an array section, accesses to the elements of the array
outside the specified array section result in unspecified behavior.

\ccppspecificstart
\item The type of a list item that appears in a reduction clause must be valid for the 
\plc{reduction-identifier}. For a \code{max} or \code{min} reduction in C, the type of the list item must 
be an allowed arithmetic data type: \code{char}, \code{int}, \code{float}, \code{double}, or \code{\_Bool}, 
possibly modified with \code{long}, \code{short}, \code{signed}, or \code{unsigned}. For a \code{max} or \code{min} 
reduction in C++, the type of the list item must be an allowed arithmetic data type: 
\code{char}, \code{wchar\_t}, \code{int}, \code{float}, \code{double}, or \code{bool}, possibly modified with \code{long}, 
\code{short}, \code{signed}, or \code{unsigned}.

\item A list item that appears in a reduction clause must not be \code{const}-qualified.

\item The \plc{reduction-identifier} for any list item must be unambiguous and accessible.
\ccppspecificend
\bigskip

\fortranspecificstart
\item The type and the rank of a list item that appears in a reduction clause
must be valid for the \plc{combiner} and \plc{initializer}.

\item A list item that appears in a reduction clause must be definable.

\item A procedure pointer may not appear in a reduction clause.

\item A pointer with the \code{INTENT(IN)} attribute may not appear in the
reduction clause.

\item An original list item with the \code{POINTER} attribute or any pointer
component of an original list item that is referenced in the \plc{combiner}
must be associated at entry to the construct that contains the reduction
clause. Additionally, the list item or the pointer component of the list item
must not be deallocated, allocated, or pointer assigned within the region.

\item An original list item with the \code{ALLOCATABLE} attribute or any
allocatable component of an original list item that is referenced in the
\plc{combiner} must be in the allocated state at entry to the construct that
contains the reduction clause. Additionally, the list item or the allocatable
component of the list item must be neither deallocated nor allocated within the
region.

\item If the \plc{reduction-identifier} is defined in a \code{declare}~\code{reduction}
directive, the \code{declare}~\code{reduction} directive must be in the same
subprogram, or accessible by host or use association.

\item If the \plc{reduction-identifier} is a user-defined operator, the same
explicit interface for that operator must be accessible as at the
\code{declare}~\code{reduction} directive.

\item If the \plc{reduction-identifier} is defined in a \code{declare}~\code{reduction}
directive, any subroutine or function referenced in the initializer clause or
combiner expression must be an intrinsic function, or must have an explicit
interface where the same explicit interface is accessible as at the
\code{declare}~\code{reduction} directive.
\fortranspecificend
\end{itemize}










\subsubsection{Reduction Scoping Clauses}
\label{subsubsec:Reduction Scoping Clauses}
Reduction scoping clauses define the region in which a reduction is computed by
tasks or SIMD lanes. All properties common to all reduction clauses,
which are defined in Section~\ref{subsubsec:Properties Common To All Reduction
Clauses}, apply to reduction scoping clauses.

The number of copies created for each list item and the time at which those
copies are initialized are determined by the particular reduction scoping clause
that appears on the construct. Any copies associated with the reduction are
initialized with the intializer value of the \plc{reduction-identifier}.


Any copies are combined using the combiner associated with the
\plc{reduction-identifier}. The time at which the original list item contains the result
of the reduction is determined by the particular reduction scoping clause.

\begin{samepage}
\fortranspecificstart
If the original list item has the \code{POINTER} attribute, copies of
the list item are associated with private targets.
\fortranspecificend
\end{samepage}

If the list item is an array section, the elements of any copy of the array section will
be allocated contiguously.

The location in the OpenMP program at which values are combined and the
order in which values are combined are unspecified. Therefore, when
comparing sequential and parallel runs, or when comparing one parallel run to
another (even if the number of threads used is the same), there is no guarantee
that bit-identical results will be obtained or that side effects (such as
floating-point exceptions) will be identical or take place at the same location
in the OpenMP program.

To avoid race conditions, concurrent reads or updates of the original list item
must be synchronized with the update of the original list item that occurs as a
result of the reduction computation.










\subsubsection{Reduction Participating Clauses}
\label{subsubsec:Reduction Participating Clauses}
A reduction participating clause specifies a task or a SIMD lane as a
participant in a reduction defined by a reduction scoping clause.
All properties common to all reduction clauses, which are defined in
Section~\ref{subsubsec:Properties Common To All Reduction Clauses}, apply to
reduction participating clauses.

Accesses to the original list item may be replaced by accesses to copies of the
original list item created by a region associated with a construct with a
reduction scoping clause.

In any case, the final value of the reduction must be determined as if all tasks
or SIMD lanes that participate in the reduction are executed sequentially in
some arbitrary order.










\subsubsection{\code{reduction} Clause}
\index{reduction@{\code{reduction}}}
\index{clauses!reduction@{\code{reduction}}}
\label{subsubsec:reduction clause}
\summary
The \code{reduction} clause specifies a \plc{reduction-identifier} and one or
more list items. For each list item, a private copy is created in each implicit
task or SIMD lane and is initialized with the initializer value of the
\plc{reduction-identifier}. After the end of the region, the original list item
is updated with the values of the private copies using the combiner associated
with the \plc{reduction-identifier}.

\syntax
\begin{boxedcode}
\code{reduction}(\plc{reduction-identifier }:\plc{ list})
\end{boxedcode}
Where \plc{reduction-identifier} is defined in Section
\ref{subsubsec:Properties Common To All Reduction Clauses}.

\descr
The \code{reduction} clause is a reduction scoping clause and a reduction
participating clause, as described in Sections \ref{subsubsec:Reduction Scoping
Clauses} and \ref{subsubsec:Reduction Participating Clauses}.

For \code{parallel} and worksharing constructs, a private copy of each list item is created, 
one for each implicit task, as if the \code{private} clause had been used. For the \code{simd} 
construct, a private copy of each list item is created, one for each SIMD lane as if the 
\code{private} clause had been used. 
For the \code{taskloop} construct, private copies are created according to the rules of the reduction scoping clauses. 
For the \code{target} construct, a private
copy of each list item is created and initialized for the initial task as if
the \code{private} clause had been used. For the \code{teams} construct, a
private copy of each list item is created and initialized, one for each team in
the league as if the \code{private} clause had been used. At the end of the
region for  which the \code{reduction} clause was specified, the original list
item is updated by combining its original value with the final value of each of
the private copies, using the combiner of the specified
\plc{reduction-identifier}.


If \code{nowait} is not used, the reduction computation will be complete at the end of the 
construct; however, if the reduction clause is used on a construct to which \code{nowait} is 
also applied, accesses to the original list item will create a race and, thus, have 
unspecified effect unless synchronization ensures that they occur after all threads have 
executed all of their iterations or \code{section} constructs, and the reduction computation 
has completed and stored the computed value of that list item. This can most simply be 
ensured through a barrier synchronization.


\restrictions
The restrictions to the \code{reduction} clause are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item All the common restrictions to all reduction clauses, which are listed in
Section \ref{subsubsec:Properties Common To All Reduction Clauses}, apply to
this clause.

\item A list item that appears in a \code{reduction} clause of a worksharing
construct must be shared in the \code{parallel} regions to which any of the

\subsection{Data Copying Clauses}
\label{subsec:Data Copying Clauses}
\index{data copying clauses}
\index{clauses!data copying}
This section describes the \code{copyin} clause (allowed on the \code{parallel} directive and 
combined parallel worksharing directives) and the \code{copyprivate} clause (allowed on 
the \code{single} directive).

These clauses support the copying of data values from private or threadprivate variables 
on one implicit task or thread to the corresponding variables on other implicit tasks or 
threads in the team.

The clauses accept a comma-separated list of list items (see \specref{sec:Directive Format}). 
All list items appearing in a clause must be visible, according to the scoping rules of the 
base language. Clauses may be repeated as needed, but a list item that specifies a given 
variable may not appear in more than one clause on the same directive.

\fortranspecificstart
An associate name preserves the association with the selector established at the \code{ASSOCIATE} statement. A list item that appears in a data copying clause may be a selector of an \code{ASSOCIATE} construct. If the construct association is established prior to a parallel region, the association between the associate name and the original list item will be retained in the region.

\index{copyin@{\code{copyin}}}
\index{clauses!copyin@{\code{copyin}}}
\label{subsubsec:copyin clause}
\summary
The \code{copyin} clause provides a mechanism to copy the value of the master thread’s 
threadprivate variable to the threadprivate variable of each other member of the team 
executing the \code{parallel} region. 

\syntax
The syntax of the \code{copyin} clause is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
copyin(\plc{list})
\end{boxedcode}

\descr
\ccppspecificstart
The copy is done after the team is formed and prior to the start of execution of the 
associated structured block. For variables of non-array type, the copy occurs by copy 
assignment. For an array of elements of non-array type, each element is copied as if by 
assignment from an element of the master thread’s array to the corresponding element of 
the other thread’s array. 
\ccppspecificend

\cppspecificstart
For class types, the copy assignment operator is invoked. The order in which copy 
assignment operators for different variables of class type are called is unspecified. 
\cppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
The copy is done, as if by assignment, after the team is formed and prior to the start of 
execution of the associated structured block.

On entry to any \code{parallel} region, each thread’s copy of a variable that is affected by 
a \code{copyin} clause for the \code{parallel} region will acquire the allocation, association, and 
definition status of the master thread’s copy, according to the following rules:

\begin{itemize}
\item If the original list item has the \code{POINTER} attribute, each copy receives the same 
association status of the master thread’s copy as if by pointer assignment.

\item If the original list item does not have the \code{POINTER} attribute, each copy becomes 
defined with the value of the master thread's copy as if by intrinsic assignment, 
unless it has the allocation status of unallocated, in which case each copy
will have the same status.
\end{itemize}
\fortranspecificend

\restrictions
The restrictions to the \code{copyin} clause are as follows:
\ccppspecificstart
\begin{itemize}
\item A list item that appears in a \code{copyin} clause must be threadprivate.

\item A variable of class type (or array thereof) that appears in a \code{copyin} clause requires

\summary
The \code{copyprivate} clause provides a mechanism to use a private variable to broadcast 
a value from the data environment of one implicit task to the data environments of the 
other implicit tasks belonging to the \code{parallel} region.

To avoid race conditions, concurrent reads or updates of the list item must be 
synchronized with the update of the list item that occurs as a result of the 
\code{copyprivate} clause.

\syntax
The syntax of the \code{copyprivate} clause is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
copyprivate(\plc{list})
\end{boxedcode}

\descr
The effect of the \code{copyprivate} clause on the specified list items occurs after the 
execution of the structured block associated with the \code{single} construct (see 
\specref{subsec:single Construct}), 
and before any of the threads in the team have left the barrier 
at the end of the construct.

\ccppspecificstart
In all other implicit tasks belonging to the \code{parallel} region, each specified list item 
becomes defined with the value of the corresponding list item in the implicit task associated with the 
thread that executed the structured block. For variables of non-array type, the definition 
occurs by copy assignment. For an array of elements of non-array type, each element is
copied by copy assignment from an element of the array in the data environment of the 
implicit task associated with the thread that executed the structured block to the 
corresponding element of the array in the data environment of the other implicit tasks
\ccppspecificend

\cppspecificstart
For class types, a copy assignment operator is invoked. The order in which copy 
assignment operators for different variables of class type are called is unspecified.

belonging to the \code{parallel} region, the list item becomes defined as if by intrinsic 
assignment with the value of the corresponding list item in the implicit task associated 
with the thread that executed the structured block. 

If the list item has the \code{POINTER} attribute, then, in all other implicit tasks belonging to 
the \code{parallel} region, the list item receives, as if by pointer assignment, the same 
association status of the corresponding list item in the implicit task associated with the 
thread that executed the structured block.

The order in which any final subroutines for different variables of a finalizable type are called is unspecified.

\subsection{Data-mapping Attribute Rules and Clauses}
\label{subsec:Data-mapping Attribute Rules and Clauses}
\index{data-mapping rules and clauses}
\index{attributes, data-mapping}

%% Do we need something about
%% ``explicit \code{declare}~\code{target} directives''?
This section describes how the data-mapping attributes of any variable 
referenced in a \code{target} region are determined. When specified, 
explicit \code{map} clauses on \code{target}~\code{data} and \code{target} 
directives determine these attributes.  Otherwise, the following 
data-mapping rules apply for variables referenced in a \code{target}
construct that are not declared in the construct and do not appear in 
data-sharing attribute or \code{map} clauses:

Certain variables and objects have predetermined data-mapping attributes 
as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item If a variable appears in a \code{to} or \code{link} clause 
on a \code{declare}~\code{target} directive then it is treated as if it had appeared in a \code{map} clause with a \plc{map-type} of \code{tofrom}.

\ccppspecificstart
\item A variable that is of type pointer is treated as if it had appeared in a \code{map} clause as a zero-length array section.
\ccppspecificend

\cppspecificstart
\item A variable that is of type reference to pointer is treated as if it had appeared in a \code{map} clause as a zero-length array section.
\cppspecificend
\end{itemize}

Otherwise, the following implicit data-mapping attribute rules apply:

\begin{itemize}
\item If a \code{defaultmap(tofrom:scalar)} clause is not present then 
a scalar variable is not mapped, but instead has an implicit data-sharing 
attribute of firstprivate (see 
\specref{subsubsec:Data-sharing Attribute Rules for Variables Referenced in a Construct}).

\item If a \code{defaultmap(tofrom:scalar)} clause is present then a scalar 
variable is treated as if it had appeared in a \code{map} clause with a 
\plc{map-type} of \code{tofrom}.

\item If a variable is not a scalar then it is treated as if it had appeared 
in a \code{map} clause with a \plc{map-type} of \code{tofrom}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\code{map} Clause}
\label{subsec:map Clause}
\index{map@{\code{map}}}
\index{clauses!map@{\code{map}}}
\summary
The \code{map} clause specifies how an original list item is mapped from the current task's data environment to a corresponding list item in the device data environment of the device identified by the construct.

\syntax
The syntax of the map clause is as follows:

\begin{boxedcode}
map(\plc{[ [map-type-modifier[,]] map-type} : \plc{] list})
\end{boxedcode}

where \plc{map-type} is one of the following:

\begin{indentedcodelist}
to
from
tofrom
alloc
release
delete
\end{indentedcodelist}

and \plc{map-type-modifier} is \code{always}.

\descr
The list items that appear in a \code{map} clause may include array sections and structure elements.

The \plc{map-type} and \plc{map-type-modifier} specify the effect of the \code{map} clause, as described below.

The original and corresponding list items may share storage such that writes to either
item by one task followed by a read or write of the other item by another task without
intervening synchronization can result in data races.

If the \code{map} clause appears on a \code{target}, \code{target}~\code{data}, or \code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data} construct then on entry to the region the following sequence of steps occurs as if performed as a single atomic operation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If a corresponding list item of the original list item is not present in the device data environment, then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A new list item with language-specific attributes is derived from the original list item and created in the device data environment.
\item The new list item becomes the corresponding list item to the original list item in the device data environment.
\item The corresponding list item has a reference count that is initialized to zero. 
\end{enumerate}
\item The corresponding list item's reference count is incremented by one.
\item If the corresponding list item's reference count is one or the \code{always} \plc{map-type-modifier} is present, then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the \plc{map-type} is \code{to} or \code{tofrom}, then the corresponding list item is assigned the value of the original list item. 
\end{enumerate}
\item If the corresponding list item's reference count is one, then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the \plc{map-type} is \code{from} or \code{alloc}, the value of the corresponding list item is undefined. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

If the \code{map} clause appears on a \code{target}, \code{target}~\code{data}, or \code{target}~\code{exit}~\code{data} construct then on exit from the region the following sequence of steps occurs as if performed as a single atomic operation:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If a corresponding list item of the original list item is not present in the device data environment, then the list item is ignored.
\item If a corresponding list item of the original list item is present in the device data environment, then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the corresponding list item's reference count is finite, then:
\begin{enumerate}
%\item the corresponding list item's reference count is decremented by one.
\item If the \plc{map-type} is not \code{delete}, then the corresponding list item's reference count is decremented by one.
\item If the \plc{map-type} is \code{delete}, then the corresponding list item's reference count is set to zero. 
\end{enumerate}
\item If the corresponding list item's reference count is zero or the \code{always} \plc{map-type-modifier} is present, then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the \plc{map-type} is \code{from} or \code{tofrom}, then the original list item is assigned the value of the corresponding list item. 
\end{enumerate}
\item If the corresponding list item's reference count is zero, then the corresponding list item is removed from the device data environment 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

If a single contiguous part of the original storage of a list item with an
implicit data-mapping attribute has corresponding storage in the device data
environment prior to a task encountering the construct associated with the
\code{map} clause, only that part of the original storage will have
corresponding storage in the device data environment as a result of the \code{map}
clause. 

\ccppspecificstart
If a new list item is created then a new list item of the same type, with automatic storage
duration, is allocated for the construct. The size and alignment of the new list
item are determined by the static type of the variable. This allocation occurs if the region
references the list item in any statement.
\ccppspecificend

\fortranspecificstart
If a new list item is created then a new list item of the same type, type parameter, and
rank is allocated.
\fortranspecificend

The \plc{map-type} determines how the new list item is initialized.

If a \plc{map-type} is not specified, the \plc{map-type} defaults to \code{tofrom}.

\events
The \plc{target-map} event occurs when a thread maps data to or from a target device.

The \plc{target-transfer} event occurs when a thread initiates a data transfer to or from a target device.

\tools

A thread dispatches a registered \code{ompt\_callback\_target\_map}
callback for each occurrence of a \plc{target-map} event in that thread. 
The callback occurs in the context of the target task.  The callback has type signature
\code{ompt\_callback\_target\_map\_t}. 

A thread dispatches a registered \code{ompt\_callback\_target\_transfer}
callback for each occurrence of a \plc{target-transfer} event in that thread. 
The callback occurs in the context of the target task.  The callback has type signature
\code{ompt\_callback\_target\_transfer\_t}. 

\restrictions
\begin{itemize}

\item A list item cannot appear in both a \code{map} clause and a data-sharing attribute clause on the same construct.

\item If a list item is an array section, it must specify contiguous storage.

\item At most one list item can be an array item derived from a given variable in \code{map}
clauses of the same construct.

\item List items of \code{map} clauses in the same construct must not share original storage.

\item If any part of the original storage of a list item with a predetermined or
explicit data-mapping attribute has corresponding storage in the device data
environment prior to a task encountering the construct associated with the map
clause, all of the original storage must have corresponding storage
in the device data environment prior to the task encountering the construct.

\item If a list item is an element of a structure, and a different element 
of the structure has a corresponding list item in the device data environment 
prior to a task encountering the construct associated with the \code{map} 
clause, then the list item must also have a correspnding list item in the 
device data environment prior to the task encountering the construct.

\item If a list item is an element of a structure, only the rightmost symbol of the variable reference can be an array section.

\item If variables that share storage are mapped, the behavior is unspecified. 

\item A list item must have a mappable type.

\item \code{threadprivate} variables cannot appear in a \code{map} clause.

\cppspecificstart
\item If the type of a list item is a reference to a type \plc{T} then the type will be considered to be \plc{T} for all purposes of this clause.
\cppspecificend

\ccppspecificstart
\item Initialization and assignment are through bitwise copy.

\item A variable for which the type is pointer and an array section derived from that variable must not appear as list items of \code{map} clauses of the same construct. 

\item A list item cannot be a variable that is a member of a structure with a union type.

\item A bit-field cannot appear in a \code{map} clause.
\ccppspecificend
\end{itemize}

\begin{samepage}

\begin{itemize}
\item The value of the new list item becomes that of the original list item in the map 
initialization and assignment.

\item A list item must not contain any components that have the
  \code{ALLOCATABLE} attribute.

\item If the allocation status of a list item with the
  \code{ALLOCATABLE} attribute is unallocated upon entry to a
  \code{target} region, the list item must be unallocated
  upon exit from the region.

\item If the allocation status of a list item with the
  \code{ALLOCATABLE} attribute is allocated upon entry to a
  \code{target} region, the allocation status of the corresponding
  list item must not be changed and must not be reshaped in the
  region.

\item If an array section is mapped and the size of the section is
  smaller than that of the whole array, the behavior of referencing
  the whole array in the \code{target} region is unspecified.

If the \plc{reduction-identifier} is the same as a generic name that is one of the allowed intrinsic procedures and is accessible, and if it has the same name as a derived type in the same module, the accessibility of the corresponding \code{declare}~\code{reduction} directive is determined by the accessibility of the generic name according to the base language.

The \plc{combiner} specifies how partial results can be combined into a single value. The 
\plc{combiner} can use the special variable identifiers \code{omp\_in} and \code{omp\_out} that are of the

If the \plc{combiner} is an assignment statement, the \plc{combiner} is evaluated by executing the 
assignment statement.

As the \plc{initializer-expr} value of a user-defined reduction is not known \emph{a priori} the 
\plc{initializer-clause} can be used to specify one. Then the contents of the \plc{initializer-clause} 
will be used as the initializer for private copies of reduction list items where the 
\code{omp\_priv} identifier will refer to the storage to be initialized. The special identifier 
\code{omp\_orig} can also appear in the \plc{initializer-clause} and it will refer to the storage of the 
original variable to be reduced.

The number of times that the \plc{initializer-expr} is evaluated, and the order of these 
evaluations, is unspecified.

\ccppspecificstart
If the \plc{initializer-expr} is a function name with an argument list, the \plc{initializer-expr} is 
evaluated by calling the function with the specified argument list. Otherwise, the 
\plc{initializer-expr} specifies how \code{omp\_priv} is declared and initialized.
\ccppspecificend

\cspecificstart
If no \plc{initializer-clause} is specified, the private variables will be initialized following the 
rules for initialization of objects with static storage duration.
\cspecificend

\cppspecificstart
If no \plc{initializer-expr} is specified, the private variables will be initialized following the 
rules for \plc{default-initialization}.
\cppspecificend
\bigskip

\fortranspecificstart
If the \plc{initializer-expr} is a subroutine name with an argument list, the \plc{initializer-expr} is 
evaluated by calling the subroutine with the specified argument list.

If the \plc{initializer-expr} is an assignment statement, the \plc{initializer-expr} is evaluated by 
executing the assignment statement.

If no \plc{initializer-clause} is specified, the private variables will be initialized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item For \code{complex}, \code{real}, or \code{integer} types, the value 0 will be used.
\item For \code{logical} types, the value \code{.false.} will be used.
\item For derived types for which default initialization is specified, default initialization 
will be used.
\item Otherwise, not specifying an \plc{initializer-clause} results in unspecified behavior.
\end{itemize}
\fortranspecificend
\bigskip

\ccppspecificstart
If \plc{reduction-identifier} is used in a \code{target} region then a \code{declare}~\code{target} construct 
must be specified for any function that can be accessed through the \plc{combiner} and 
\plc{initializer-expr}.
\ccppspecificend
\bigskip

\fortranspecificstart
If \plc{reduction-identifier} is used in a \code{target} region then a \code{declare}~\code{target} construct 
must be specified for any function or subroutine that can be accessed through the \plc{combiner} 
and \plc{initializer-expr}.
\fortranspecificend

\restrictions
\begin{itemize}
\item Only the variables \code{omp\_in} and \code{omp\_out} are allowed in the \plc{combiner}.

\item Only the variables \code{omp\_priv} and \code{omp\_orig} are allowed in the \plc{initializer-clause}.

\item If the variable \code{omp\_orig} is modified in the \plc{initializer-clause}, the behavior is 
unspecified. 

\item If execution of the \plc{combiner} or the \plc{initializer-expr} results in the execution of an 
OpenMP construct or an OpenMP API call, then the behavior is unspecified.

\item A \plc{reduction-identifier} may not be re-declared in the current scope for the same type 
or for a type that is compatible according to the base language rules.

\item At most one \plc{initializer-clause} can be specified. 

\ccppspecificstart
\item A type name in a \code{declare}~\code{reduction} directive cannot be a function type, an 
array type, a reference type, or a type qualified with \code{const}, \code{volatile} or 
\code{restrict}. 
\ccppspecificend
\bigskip

\cspecificstart
\item If the \plc{initializer-expr} is a function name with an argument list, then one of the 
arguments must be the address of \code{omp\_priv}. 
\cspecificend
\bigskip

\cppspecificstart
\item If the \plc{initializer-expr} is a function name with an argument list, then one of the 
arguments must be \code{omp\_priv} or the address of \code{omp\_priv}. 
\cppspecificend
\bigskip

\fortranspecificstart
\item If the \plc{initializer-expr} is a subroutine name with an argument list, then one of the 
arguments must be \code{omp\_priv}.

\item If the \code{declare}~\code{reduction} directive appears in the specification part of a module and the corresponding reduction clause does not appear in the same module, the \plc{reduction-identifier} must be the same as the name of a user-defined operator, one of the allowed operators that is extended or a generic name that is the same as the name of one of the allowed intrinsic procedures. 

\item If the \code{declare}~\code{reduction} directive appears in the specification of a module, if the corresponding \code{reduction} clause does not appear in the same module, and if the \plc{reduction-identifier} is the same as the name of a user-defined operator or an extended operator, or the same as a generic name that is the same as one of the allowed intrinsic procedures then the interface for that operator or the generic name must be defined in the specification of the same module, or must be accessible by use association. 

\item Any subroutine or function used in the \code{initializer} clause or \plc{combiner} expression must be an intrinsic function, or must have an accessible interface. 

\item Any user-defined operator or extended operator used in the \code{initializer} clause or \plc{combiner} expression must have an accessible interface. 

\item If any subroutine, function, user-defined operator, or extended operator is used in the \code{initializer} clause or \plc{combiner} expression, it must be accessible to the subprogram in which the corresponding \code{reduction} clause is specified. 

\item If the length type parameter is specified for a character type, it must be a constant, a colon or an~\code{*}. 

\item If a character type with deferred or assumed length parameter is specified in a \code{declare}~\code{reduction} directive, no other \code{declare}~\code{reduction} directive with Fortran character type of the same kind parameter and the same \plc{reduction-identifier} is allowed in the same scope.

\item Any subroutine used in the \code{initializer} clause or \plc{combiner} expression must not have any alternate returns appear in the argument list.

\section{Nesting of Regions}
\label{sec:Nesting of Regions}
\index{nesting of regions}
This section describes a set of restrictions on the nesting of regions. The restrictions on 
nesting are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item A worksharing region may not be closely nested inside a worksharing, \code{task}, \code{taskloop},
\code{critical}, \code{ordered}, \code{atomic}, or \code{master} region.

\item A \code{barrier} region may not be closely nested inside a worksharing, \code{task}, \code{taskloop},
\code{critical}, \code{ordered}, \code{atomic}, or \code{master} region.

\item A \code{master} region may not be closely nested inside a worksharing,
\code{atomic}, \code{task}, or \code{taskloop} region.

\item An \code{ordered} region arising from an \code{ordered} construct without
any clause or with the \code{threads} or \code{depend} clause may not be closely
nested inside a \code{critical}, \code{ordered}, \code{atomic}, \code{task},
or \code{taskloop} region. 

\item An \code{ordered} region arising from an \code{ordered} construct without
any clause or with the \code{threads} or \code{depend} clause must be closely nested
inside a loop region (or parallel loop region) with an \code{ordered} clause.

\item An \code{ordered} region arising from an \code{ordered} construct with the
\code{simd} clause must be closely nested inside a \code{simd} (or loop SIMD)
region.

\item An \code{ordered} region arising from an \code{ordered} construct with
  both the \code{simd} and \code{threads} clauses must be closely nested inside
  a loop SIMD region.

\item A \code{critical} region may not be nested (closely or otherwise) inside a \code{critical} 
region with the same name. This restriction is not sufficient to prevent 
deadlock.

\item OpenMP constructs may not be encountered during execution of an
\code{atomic} region.

\item An \code{ordered} construct with the \code{simd} clause is the only OpenMP
construct that can be encountered during execution of a \code{simd}
region.

\item If a \code{target}, \code{target}~\code{update}, 
\code{target}~\code{data}, \code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data}, or 
\code{target}~\code{exit}~\code{data} construct is encountered during
execution of a \code{target} region, the behavior is unspecified.

\item If specified, a \code{teams} construct must be contained within a \code{target} construct. That 
\code{target} construct must not contain any statements or directives outside of the \code{teams} 
construct. 

\item \code{distribute}, \code{distribute simd}, distribute parallel loop,
distribute parallel loop SIMD, and \code{parallel} regions, including any
\code{parallel} regions arising from combined constructs, are the only OpenMP regions
that may be strictly nested inside the \code{teams} region.

\item The region associated with the \code{distribute} construct must be
strictly nested inside a \code{teams} region.

\item If \plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{taskgroup}, the \code{cancel}
construct must be closely nested inside a \code{task} construct and the
\code{cancel} region must be closely nested inside a \code{taskgroup} region. If
\plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{sections}, the \code{cancel} construct
must be closely nested inside a \code{sections} or \code{section} construct.
Otherwise, the \code{cancel} construct must be closely
nested inside an OpenMP construct that matches the type specified in
\plc{construct-type-clause} of the \code{cancel} construct.

\item A \code{cancellation}~\code{point} construct for which
\plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{taskgroup} must be closely nested
inside a \code{task} construct, and the \code{cancellation}~\code{point}
region must be closely nested inside a \code{taskgroup} region. A
\code{cancellation}~\code{point} construct for which
\plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{sections} must be closely nested
inside a \code{sections} or \code{section} construct. Otherwise, a
\code{cancellation}~\code{point} construct must be closely nested inside
an OpenMP construct that matches the type specified in
\plc{construct-type-clause}.

\end{itemize}
