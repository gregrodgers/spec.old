\subsection{Device Initialization}
\label{subsec:Device Initialization}

\events

The \plc{device-initialize} event occurs in a thread that encounters the first 
\code{target}, \code{target data}, or \code{target enter data} construct 
or a device memory routine that 
is associated with a particular target device after the thread initiates 
initialization of OpenMP on the device and the device's OpenMP initialization, 
which may include device-side tool initialization, completes.

The \plc{device-load} event for a code block for a target device occurs in some 
thread before any thread executes code from that code block on that target device.

The \plc{device-unload} event for a target device occurs in some thread
whenever a code block is unloaded from the device.

The \plc{device-finalize} event for a target device that has been initialized
occurs in some thread before an OpenMP implementation shuts down.

\tools

A thread dispatches a registered \code{ompt_callback_device_initialize}
callback for each occurrence of a \plc{device-initialize} event in that 
thread.  This callback has type signature \code{ompt_callback_device_initialize_t}.

A thread dispatches a registered \code{ompt_callback_device_load} callback 
for each occurrence of a \plc{device-load} event in that thread. This callback 
has type signature \code{ompt_callback_device_load_t}.

A thread dispatches a registered \code{ompt_callback_device_unload}
callback for each occurrence of a \plc{device-unload} event in
that thread.  This callback has type signature
\code{ompt_callback_device_unload_t}.

A thread dispatches a registered \code{ompt_callback_device_finalize}
callback for each occurrence of a \plc{device-finalize} event in
that thread.  This callback has type signature
\code{ompt_callback_device_finalize_t}.

\restrictions
No thread may offload execution of an OpenMP construct to a device until a
dispatched \code{ompt_callback_device_initialize} callback completes.

No thread may offload execution of an OpenMP construct to a device after a
dispatched \code{ompt_callback_device_finalize} callback occurs.

\summary
Map variables to a device data environment for the extent of the region.

\syntax
\begin{ccppspecific}
The syntax of the \code{target}~\code{data} construct is as follows:

\begin{ompcPragma}
#pragma omp target data \plc{clause[ [ [},\plc{] clause] ... ] new-line}
    \plc{structured-block}

\end{indentedcodelist}
\end{samepage}

\medskip

\begin{fortranspecific}
The syntax of the \code{target}~\code{data} construct is as follows:

\begin{ompfPragma}
!$omp target data \plc{clause[ [ [},\plc{] clause] ... ]}
    \plc{structured-block}
!$omp end target data
\end{ompfPragma}

where \plc{clause} is one of the following:

\begin{indentedcodelist}
if(\plc{[} target data :\plc{] scalar-logical-expression})
device(\plc{scalar-integer-expression})
map(\plc{[[map-type-modifier[},\plc{] [map-type-modifier[},\plc{] ...] map-type}:\plc{ ] locator-list})
use_device_ptr(\plc{ptr-list})
use_device_addr(\plc{list})
\end{indentedcodelist}

\end{fortranspecific}

\binding
The binding task set for a \code{target}~\code{data} region is the generating task. 
The \code{target}~\code{data} region binds to the region of the generating task.

\descr
When a \code{target}~\code{data} construct is encountered, the encountering task
executes the region. If there is no \code{device} clause, the default device is
determined by the \plc{default-device-var} ICV. When an \code{if} clause is present 
and the \code{if} clause expression evaluates to \plc{false}, the device is the host.
Variables are mapped for the extent of the region, according to any data-mapping 
attribute clauses, from the data environment of the encountering task to the 
device data environment.

Pointers that appear in a \code{use_device_ptr} clause are privatized and the
device pointers to the corresponding list items in the device data environment
are assigned into the private versions.  

List items that appear in a \code{use_device_addr} clause have the address of
the corresponding object in the device data environment inside the construct.
For objects, any reference to the value of the object will be to the
corresponding object on the device, while references to the address will result
in a valid device address that points to that object.  Array sections privatize the
base of the array section and assign the private copy to the address of the
corresponding array section in the device data environment.  

If one or more of the \code{use_device_ptr} or
\code{use_device_addr} clauses and one or more \code{map} clauses are present on the
same construct, the address conversions of \code{use_device_addr} and
\code{use_device_ptr} clauses will occur as if performed after all variables
are mapped according to those \code{map} clauses.

\events

The events associated with entering a target data region are the same events
as associated with a target enter data construct, described in 
\specref{subsec:target enter data Construct}. 
 
The events associated with exiting a target data region are the same events
as associated with a target exit data construct, described in
\specref{subsec:target exit data Construct}. 

\tools

The tool callbacks dispatched when entering a target data region are
the same as the tool callbacks dispatched when encountering
a target enter data construct, described in
\specref{subsec:target enter data Construct}.
 
The tool callbacks dispatched when exiting a target data region are
the same as the tool callbacks dispatched when encountering
a target exit data construct, described in
\specref{subsec:target exit data Construct}.

\restrictions
\begin{itemize}
\item A program must not depend on any ordering of the evaluations of the
      clauses of the \code{target}~\code{data} directive, except as explicitly
      stated for \code{map} clauses relative to \code{use_device_ptr} and
      \code{use_device_addr} clauses, or on any side effects of the evaluations 
      of the clauses.
\item At most one \code{device} clause can appear on the directive. The
      \code{device} clause expression  must evaluate to a non-negative integer
      value less than the value of \code{omp_get_num_devices()} or to the value of
      \code{omp_get_initial_device()}.
\item At most one \code{if} clause can appear on the directive.
\item A \plc{map-type} in a \code{map} clause must be \code{to}, \code{from}, 
      \code{tofrom} or \code{alloc}.
\item At least one \code{map}, \code{use_device_addr} or \code{use_device_ptr}
      clause must appear on the directive.
\item A list item in a \code{use_device_ptr} clause must hold the address of
      an object that has a corresponding list item in the device data environment.
\item A list item in a \code{use_device_addr} clause must have a
      corresponding list item in the device data environment.
\item A list item that specifies a given variable may not appear in more than
      one \code{use_device_ptr} clause.

\summary
The \code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data} directive specifies that variables 
are mapped to a device data environment. The \code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data} 
directive is a stand-alone directive.

\syntax

\begin{ccppspecific}
The syntax of the \code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data} construct is as follows:
\begin{ompcPragma}
#pragma omp target enter data \plc{[ clause[ [},\plc{] clause]...] new-line}

depend(\plc{[depend-modifier},\plc{] dependence-type }:\plc{ locator-list})
nowait
\end{indentedcodelist}
\end{fortranspecific}

\binding
The binding task set for a \code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data} region is
the generating task, which is the \plc{target task} generated by the
\code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data} construct. The
\code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data} region binds to the corresponding
\plc{target task} region.

\descr
When a \code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data} construct is encountered, the 
list items are mapped to the device data environment according to the \code{map} 
clause semantics.

The \code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data} construct is a task generating 
construct.  The generated task is a \plc{target task}.  The generated task 
region encloses the \code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data} region.

All clauses are evaluated when the \code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data} 
construct is encountered.  The data environment of the \plc{target task} 
is created according to the data-sharing attribute clauses on the 
\code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data} construct, per-data environment ICVs, 
and any default data-sharing attribute rules that apply to the 
\code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data} construct.  A variable that is 
mapped in the \code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data} construct has a 
default data-sharing attribute of shared in the data environment of 
the \plc{target task}.

Assignment operations associated with mapping a variable (see 
\specref{subsec:map Clause}) occur when the \plc{target task} executes.

If the \code{nowait} clause is present, execution of the \plc{target task} 
may be deferred.  If the \code{nowait} clause is not present, the 
\plc{target task} is an included task.

If a \code{depend} clause is present, it is associated with the \plc{target task}.

If no \code{device} clause is present, the default device is determined by the 
\plc{default-device-var} ICV.

When an \code{if} clause is present and the \code{if} clause expression 
evaluates to \plc{false}, the device is the host.

\events

Events associated with a \plc{target task} are the same as for the \code{task} 
construct defined in \specref{subsec:task Construct}.

The \plc{target-enter-data-begin} event occurs when a thread enters a
\code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data} region.

The \plc{target-enter-data-end} event occurs when a thread exits a
\code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data} region.

\tools
Callbacks associated with events for \plc{target tasks} are the same as 
for the \code{task} construct defined in \specref{subsec:task Construct};
\code{(}\plc{flags}~\code{&}~\code{ompt_task_target)} 
always evaluates to \plc{true} in the dispatched callback.

A thread dispatches a registered \code{ompt_callback_target} callback with
\code{ompt_scope_begin} as its \plc{endpoint} argument and
\code{ompt_target_enter_data} as its \plc{kind} argument for each occurrence
of a \plc{target-enter-data-begin} event in that thread in the context of the 
target task on the host. Similarly, a thread dispatches a registered 
\code{ompt_callback_target} callback with \code{ompt_scope_end} as its
\plc{endpoint} argument and \code{ompt_target_enter_data} as its \plc{kind}
argument for each occurrence of a \plc{target-enter-data-end} event in that thread
in the context of the target task on the host. These callbacks have
type signature \code{ompt_callback_target_t}.

\restrictions
\begin{itemize}
\item A program must not depend on any ordering of the evaluations of the clauses 
      of the \code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data} directive, or on any side 
      effects of the evaluations of the clauses.
\item At least one \code{map} clause must appear on the directive.
\item At most one \code{device} clause can appear on the directive. The 
      \code{device} clause expression must evaluate to a non-negative integer 
      value less than the value of \code{omp_get_num_devices()} or to the 
      value of \code{omp_get_initial_device()}.
\item At most one \code{if} clause can appear on the directive.
\item A \plc{map-type} must be specified in all \code{map} clauses and must be 
      either \code{to} or \code{alloc}.
\item At most one \code{nowait} clause can appear on the directive.

\binding
The binding task set for a \code{target}~\code{exit}~\code{data} region is
the generating task, which is the \plc{target task} generated by the
\code{target}~\code{exit}~\code{data} construct. The
\code{target}~\code{exit}~\code{data} region binds to the corresponding
\plc{target task} region.

\descr
When a \code{target}~\code{exit}~\code{data} construct is encountered, the list 
items in the \code{map} clauses are unmapped from the device data environment 
according to the \code{map} clause semantics.

The \code{target}~\code{exit}~\code{data} construct is a task generating construct.  
The generated task is a \plc{target task}.  The generated task region encloses the 
\code{target}~\code{exit}~\code{data} region.

All clauses are evaluated when the \code{target}~\code{exit}~\code{data} construct 
is encountered.  The data environment of the \plc{target task} is created according 
to the data-sharing attribute clauses on the \code{target}~\code{exit}~\code{data} 
construct, per-data environment ICVs, and any default data-sharing attribute rules 
that apply to the \code{target}~\code{exit}~\code{data} construct.  A variable that 
is mapped in the \code{target}~\code{exit}~\code{data} construct has a default 
data-sharing attribute of shared in the data environment of the \plc{target task}.

Assignment operations associated with mapping a variable (see 
\specref{subsec:map Clause}) occur when the \plc{target task} executes.

If the \code{nowait} clause is present, execution of the \plc{target task} may be 
deferred.  If the \code{nowait} clause is not present, the \plc{target task} is an 
included task.

If a \code{depend} clause is present, it is associated with the \plc{target task}.

If no \code{device} clause is present, the default device is determined by the 
\plc{default-device-var} ICV.

When an \code{if} clause is present and the \code{if} clause expression evaluates 
to \plc{false}, the device is the host.

\events

Events associated with a \plc{target task} are the same as for the \code{task} 
construct defined in \specref{subsec:task Construct}.

The \plc{target-exit-data-begin} event occurs when a thread enters a
\code{target}~\code{exit}~\code{data} region.

The \plc{target-exit-data-end} event occurs when a thread exits a
\code{target}~\code{exit}~\code{data} region.

\tools

Callbacks associated with events for \plc{target tasks} are the same as
for the \code{task} construct defined in \specref{subsec:task Construct};
\code{(}\plc{flags}~\code{&}~\code{ompt_task_target)} 
always evaluates to \plc{true} in the dispatched callback.

A thread dispatches a registered \code{ompt_callback_target} callback with
\code{ompt_scope_begin} as its \plc{endpoint} argument and
\code{ompt_target_exit_data} as its \plc{kind} argument for each occurrence
of a \plc{target-exit-data-begin} event in that thread in the context of the
target task on the host. Similarly, a thread dispatches a registered

\binding
The binding task set for a \code{target} region is the generating task, which is 
the \plc{target task} generated by the \code{target} construct. The \code{target}
region binds to the corresponding \plc{target task} region.

\descr
The \code{target} construct provides a superset of the functionality provided by 
the \code{target}~\code{data} directive, except for the \code{use_device_ptr} and 
\code{use_device_addr} clauses.

The functionality added to the \code{target} directive is the inclusion of an 
executable region to be executed by a device. That is, the \code{target} directive 
is an executable directive.

The \code{target} construct is a task generating construct.  The generated task is 
a \plc{target task}.  The generated task region encloses the \code{target} region.

All clauses are evaluated when the \code{target} construct is encountered.
The data environment of the \plc{target task} is created according to the
data-sharing attribute clauses on the \code{target} construct, per-data
environment ICVs, and any default data-sharing attribute rules that apply to
the \code{target} construct.  If a variable or part of a variable is mapped by
the \code{target} construct and does not appear as a list item in an
\code{in_reduction} clause on the construct, the variable has a default
data-sharing attribute of shared in the data environment of the \plc{target task}.

Assignment operations associated with mapping a variable (see 
\specref{subsec:map Clause}) occur when the \plc{target task} executes.

If a \code{device} clause in which the \code{device_num} \plc{device-modifier} 
appears is present on the construct, the \code{device} clause expression specifies 
the device number of the target device. If \plc{device-modifier} does not appear 
in the clause, the behavior of the clause is as if \plc{device-modifier} is 
\code{device_num}.

If a \code{device} clause in which the \code{ancestor} \plc{device-modifier} 
appears is present on the \code{target} construct and the \code{device} clause 
expression evaluates to 1, execution of the \code{target} region occurs on the 
parent device of the enclosing \code{target} region.  If the \code{target} 
construct is not encountered in a \code{target} region, the current device is 
treated as the parent device.  The encountering thread waits for completion of the
\code{target} region on the parent device before resuming. For any list item
that appears in a \code{map} clause on the same construct, if the
corresponding list item exists in the device data environment of the parent
device, it is treated as if it has a reference count of positive infinity.

If the \code{nowait} clause is present, execution of the \plc{target task} may be 
deferred.  If the \code{nowait} clause is not present, the \plc{target task} is an 
included task.

If a \code{depend} clause is present, it is associated with the \plc{target task}.

When an \code{if} clause is present and the \code{if} clause expression evaluates 
to \plc{false}, the \code{target} region is executed by the host device in the host 
data environment.

The \code{is_device_ptr} clause is used to indicate that a list item is a device
pointer already in the device data environment and that it should be used
directly.  Support for device pointers created outside of OpenMP, specifically
outside of the \code{omp_target_alloc} routine and the \code{use_device_ptr} clause,
is implementation defined.

If a function (C, C++, Fortran) or subroutine (Fortran) is referenced in a
\code{target} construct then that function or subroutine is treated as if its
name had appeared in a \code{to} clause on a \code{declare}~\code{target}
directive.

Each memory \plc{allocator} specified in the \code{uses_allocators} clause will 
be made available in the \code{target} region. For each non-predefined allocator 
that is specified, a new allocator handle will be associated with an allocator 
that is created with the specified \plc{traits} as if by a call to 
\code{omp_init_allocator} at the beginning of the \code{target} region. Each 
non-predefined allocator will be destroyed as if by a call to 
\code{omp_destroy_allocator} at the end of the \code{target} region.

\begin{ccppspecific}

If a list item in a \code{map} clause has a base pointer and it is a
scalar variable with a predetermined data-sharing attribute of firstprivate
(see \specref{subsubsec:Data-sharing Attribute Rules for Variables Referenced
in a Construct}), then on entry to the \code{target} region:

\begin{itemize}
\item If the list item is not a zero-length array section, the corresponding
private variable is initialized such that the corresponding list item in the
device data environment can be accessed through the pointer in the
\code{target} region.

\item If the list item is a zero-length array section, the corresponding
private variable is initialized such that the corresponding storage location
of the array section can be referenced through the pointer in the \code{target}
region. If the corresponding storage location is not present in the device
data environment, the corresponding private variable is initialized to NULL.
\end{itemize}

\end{ccppspecific}

\events

Events associated with a \plc{target task} are the same as for the \code{task} 
construct defined in \specref{subsec:task Construct}.

Events associated with the \plc{initial task} that executes the \code{target} 
region are defined in \specref{subsec:Initial Task}.

The \plc{target-begin} event occurs when a thread enters a \code{target} region.

The \plc{target-end} event occurs when a thread exits a \code{target} region.

The \plc{target-submit} event occurs prior to creating an initial task on 
a target device for a \code{target} region.

\tools

Callbacks associated with events for \plc{target tasks} are the same as
for the \code{task} construct defined in \specref{subsec:task Construct};
\code{(}\plc{flags}~\code{&}~\code{ompt_task_target)} 
always evaluates to \plc{true} in the dispatched callback.

A thread dispatches a registered \code{ompt_callback_target} callback with 
\code{ompt_scope_begin} as its \plc{endpoint} argument and \code{ompt_target} as 
its \plc{kind} argument for each occurrence of a \plc{target-begin} event in that 
thread in the context of the target task on the host. Similarly, a thread dispatches 
a registered \code{ompt_callback_target} callback with \code{ompt_scope_end} as its 
\plc{endpoint} argument and \code{ompt_target} as its \plc{kind} argument for each 
occurrence of a \plc{target-end} event in that thread in the context of the target 
task on the host. These callbacks have type signature \code{ompt_callback_target_t}. 

A thread dispatches a registered \code{ompt_callback_target_submit} callback for 
each occurrence of a \plc{target-submit} event in that thread. The callback has 
type signature \code{ompt_callback_target_submit_t}.

\item No OpenMP constructs or calls to OpenMP API runtime routines are allowed
      inside the corresponding \code{target} region.
\end{itemize}

\item Memory allocators that do not appear in a \code{uses_allocators} clause

\summary
The \code{target}~\code{update} directive makes the corresponding list items in 
the device data environment consistent with their original list items, according 
to the specified motion clauses. The \code{target}~\code{update} construct is a 
stand-alone directive.

\syntax
\begin{ccppspecific}
The syntax of the \code{target}~\code{update} construct is as follows:

\begin{ompcPragma}
#pragma omp target update \plc{clause[ [ [},\plc{] clause] ... ] new-line}
\end{ompcPragma}
where \plc{clause} is either \plc{motion-clause} or one of the following:

\begin{indentedcodelist}
if(\plc{[} target update :\plc{] scalar-expression})
device(\plc{integer-expression})
nowait
depend(\plc{[depend-modifier},\plc{] dependence-type }:\plc{ locator-list})
\end{indentedcodelist}

and \plc{motion-clause} is one of the following:

\begin{indentedcodelist}
to([mapper(\plc{mapper-identifier}):]\plc{locator-list})
from([mapper(\plc{mapper-identifier}):]\plc{locator-list})
\end{indentedcodelist}
\end{ccppspecific}

\begin{fortranspecific}
The syntax of the \code{target}~\code{update} construct is as follows:

\begin{ompfPragma}
!$omp target update \plc{clause[ [ [},\plc{] clause] ... ]}
\end{ompfPragma} %$ close off misinterpreted dollar sign/math symbol

where \plc{clause} is either \plc{motion-clause} or one of the following:

\begin{indentedcodelist}
if(\plc{[}target update :\plc{] scalar-logical-expression})
device(\plc{scalar-integer-expression})
nowait
depend(\plc{[depend-modifier},\plc{] dependence-type }:\plc{ locator-list})
\end{indentedcodelist}

and \plc{motion-clause} is one of the following:

\begin{indentedcodelist}
to([mapper(\plc{mapper-identifier}):]\plc{locator-list})
from([mapper(\plc{mapper-identifier}):]\plc{locator-list})
\end{indentedcodelist}
\end{fortranspecific}

\binding
The binding task set for a \code{target}~\code{update} region is the
generating task, which is the \plc{target task} generated
by the \code{target}~\code{update} construct. The \code{target}~\code{update}
region binds to the corresponding \plc{target task} region.

\descr
For each list item in a \code{to} or \code{from} clause there is a corresponding 
list item and an original list item. If the corresponding list item is not present 
in the device data environment then no assignment occurs to or from the original 
list item. Otherwise, each corresponding list item in the device data environment 
has an original list item in the current task's data environment.  If a 
\code{mapper()} modifier appears in a \code{to} clause, each list item is replaced 
with the list items that the given mapper specifies are to be mapped
with a \code{to} or \code{tofrom} map-type. If a \code{mapper()} modifier
appears in a \code{from} clause, each list item is replaced with the list items
that the given mapper specifies are to be mapped with a \code{from} or
\code{tofrom} map-type.

For each list item in a \code{from} or a \code{to} clause: 

\begin{itemize}
\item For each part of the list item that is an attached pointer:  

\begin{itemize}
\item On exit from the region that part of the original list item will
      have the value it had on entry to the region;
\item On exit from the region that part of the corresponding list item will
      have the value it had on entry to the region;
\end{itemize}

\item For each part of the list item that is not an attached pointer: 

\begin{itemize}
\item If the clause is \code{from}, the value of that part of the corresponding 
      list item is assigned to that part of the original list item;
\item If the clause is \code{to}, the value of that part of the original list 
      item is assigned to that part of the corresponding list item.
\end{itemize}

\item To avoid data races: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Concurrent reads or updates of any part of the original list item must be 
      synchronized with the update of the original list item that occurs as a 
      result of the \code{from} clause;
\item Concurrent reads or updates of any part of the corresponding list item must 
      be synchronized with the update of the corresponding list item that occurs 
      as a result of the \code{to} clause.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


\begin{ccppspecific}
The list items that appear in the \code{to} or \code{from} clauses may
use shape-operators.
\end{ccppspecific}

The list items that appear in the \code{to} or \code{from} clauses may
include array sections with \plc{stride} expressions.

The \code{target}~\code{update} construct is a task generating construct.  
The generated task is a \plc{target task}.  The generated task region encloses 
the \code{target}~\code{update} region.

All clauses are evaluated when the \code{target}~\code{update} construct is 
encountered.  The data environment of the \plc{target task} is created according 
to the data-sharing attribute clauses on the \code{target}~\code{update} construct, 
per-data environment ICVs, and any default data-sharing attribute rules that apply 
to the \code{target}~\code{update} construct.  A variable that is mapped in the 
\code{target}~\code{update} construct has a default data-sharing attribute of 
\code{shared} in the data environment of the \plc{target task}.

Assignment operations associated with mapping a variable (see 
\specref{subsec:map Clause}) occur when the \plc{target task} executes.

If the \code{nowait} clause is present, execution of the \plc{target task} may 
be deferred.  If the \code{nowait} clause is not present, the \plc{target task} 
is an included task.

If a \code{depend} clause is present, it is associated with the \plc{target task}.

The device is specified in the \code{device} clause. If there is no \code{device} 
clause, the device is determined by the \plc{default-device-var} ICV. When an 
\code{if} clause is present and the \code{if} clause expression evaluates to 
\plc{false} then no assignments occur.

\events

Events associated with a \plc{target task} are the same as for the \code{task} 
construct defined in \specref{subsec:task Construct}.

The \plc{target-update-begin} event occurs when a thread enters a
\code{target}~\code{update} region.

The \plc{target-update-end} event occurs when a thread exits a
\code{target}~\code{update} region.

\tools

Callbacks associated with events for \plc{target tasks} are the same as
for the \code{task} construct defined in \specref{subsec:task Construct};
\code{(}\plc{flags}~\code{&}~\code{ompt_task_target)} 
always evaluates to \plc{true} in the dispatched callback.

A thread dispatches a registered \code{ompt_callback_target} callback with 
\code{ompt_scope_begin} as its \plc{endpoint} argument and 
\code{ompt_target_update} as its \plc{kind} argument for each occurrence 
of a \plc{target-update-begin} event in that thread in the context of the 
target task on the host. Similarly, a thread dispatches a registered 
\code{ompt_callback_target} callback with \code{ompt_scope_end} as its 
\plc{endpoint} argument and \code{ompt_target_update} as its \plc{kind} 
argument for each occurrence of a \plc{target-update-end} event in that thread 
in the context of the target task on the host. These callbacks have 
type signature \code{ompt_callback_target_t}. 



\restrictions
\begin{itemize}
\item A program must not depend on any ordering of the evaluations of the 
      clauses of the \code{target}~\code{update} directive, or on any side 
      effects of the evaluations of the clauses.
\item At least one \plc{motion-clause} must be specified.
\item A list item can only appear in a \code{to} or \code{from} clause, but not both.
\item A list item in a \code{to} or \code{from} clause must have a mappable type.
\item At most one \code{device} clause can appear on the directive. The
      \code{device} clause expression must evaluate to a non-negative integer 
      value less than the value of \code{omp_get_num_devices()} or to the value of 
      \code{omp_get_initial_device()}.
\item At most one \code{if} clause can appear on the directive.
\item At most one \code{nowait} clause can appear on the directive.

\label{subsec:declare target Directive}
\summary
The \code{declare}~\code{target} directive specifies that variables,
functions (C, C++ and Fortran), and subroutines (Fortran) are mapped
to a device. The \code{declare}~\code{target} directive is a declarative
directive.

\syntax
\begin{ccppspecific}
The syntax of the \code{declare}~\code{target} directive takes either of
the following forms:

\begin{ompcPragma}
#pragma omp declare target \plc{new-line}
\plc{declaration-definition-seq}
#pragma omp end declare target \plc{new-line}
\end{ompcPragma}

or

\begin{ompcPragma}

\end{ompcPragma}

or

\begin{ompcPragma}
#pragma omp declare target \plc{clause[ [},\plc{] clause ... ] new-line}
\end{ompcPragma}

where \plc{clause} is one of the following:

\begin{indentedcodelist}
to(\plc{extended-list})
link(\plc{list})
implements(\plc{function-name})
device_type(host \textnormal{| nohost \textnormal{|} any})
\end{indentedcodelist}
\end{ccppspecific}

\begin{fortranspecific}
The syntax of the \code{declare}~\code{target} directive is as follows:

\begin{ompfPragma}
!$omp declare target (\plc{extended-list})
\end{ompfPragma}

or

\begin{ompfPragma}
!$omp declare target \plc{[clause[ [},\plc{] clause] ... ]}
\end{ompfPragma}

where \plc{clause} is one of the following:

\begin{indentedcodelist}
to(\plc{extended-list})
link(\plc{list})
implements(\plc{subroutine-name})
device_type(host \textnormal{| nohost \textnormal{|} any})
\end{indentedcodelist}
\end{fortranspecific}

\descr

The \code{declare} \code{target} directive ensures that procedures
and global variables can be executed or accessed on a device.
Variables are mapped for all device executions, or for specific
device executions through a \code{link} clause.

If an \plc{extended-list} is present with no clause then the \code{to}
clause is assumed.

The \code{implements} clause specifies that an alternate version of a 
procedure should be used.

The \code{device_type} clause specifies if a version of the procedure should be made
available on host, device or both. If \code{host} is specified only a host version
of the procedure is made available.  If \code{nohost} is specified then only a device
version of the procedure is made available.  If \code{any} is specified then both
device and host versions of the procedure are made available.

\begin{ccppspecific}
If a function appears in a \code{to} clause in the same translation unit in which 
the definition of the function occurs then a device-specific version of the function 
is created.

If a variable appears in a \code{to} clause in the same translation unit in which 
the definition of the variable occurs then the original list item is allocated a 
corresponding list item in the device data environment of all devices.

All calls in \code{target} constructs to the function in the \code{implements} clause
are replaced by the function following the \code{declare} \code{target} constructs.
\end{ccppspecific}

\begin{fortranspecific}
If an internal procedure appears in a \code{to} clause
then a device-specific version of the procedure is created.

If a variable that is host associated appears in a \code{to} clause
then the original list item is allocated a corresponding list item in the
device data environment of all devices.

All calls in \code{target} constructs to the procedure in the \code{implements}
clause are replaced by the procedure in which \code{declare} \code{target} 
construct appeared.
\end{fortranspecific}

If a variable appears in a \code{to} clause then the corresponding list
item in the device data environment of each device is initialized once, in the
manner specified by the program, but at an unspecified point in the program
prior to the first reference to that list item.  The list item is never removed
from those device data environments as if its reference count is initialized to
positive infinity.

Including list items in a \code{link} clause supports compilation of
functions called in a \code{target} region that refer to the list
items.  The list items are not mapped by the \code{declare}~\code{target}
directive.  Instead, they are mapped according to the data mapping
rules described in 
\specref{subsec:Data-Mapping Attribute Rules, Clauses, and Directives}.

\begin{ccppspecific}
If a function is referenced in a function that appears as a list item in a \code{to}
clause on a \code{declare}~\code{target} directive then the name of the referenced 
function is treated as if it had appeared in a \code{to} clause on a 
\code{declare}~\code{target} directive.

If a variable with static storage duration or a function (except \plc{lambda}
for C++) is referenced in the initializer expression list of a variable with
static storage duration that appears as a list item in a \code{to} clause on a 
\code{declare}~\code{target} directive then the name of the referenced variable 
or function is treated as if it had appeared in a \code{to} clause on a 
\code{declare}~\code{target} directive.

The form of the \code{declare}~\code{target} directive that has no clauses
and requires a matching \code{end}~\code{declare}~\code{target} directive
defines an implicit \plc{extended-list} to an implicit \code{to}
clause. The implicit \plc{extended-list} consists of the variable names
of any variable declarations at file or namespace scope that appear between
the two directives and of the function names of any function declarations at
file, namespace or class scope that appear between the two directives.

The \plc{declaration-definition-seq} defined by a
\code{declare}~\code{target} directive and an
\code{end}~\code{declare}~\code{target} directive may contain
\code{declare}~\code{target} directives. If a \code{device_type} clause
is present on the contained \code{declare}~\code{target} directive, then its
argument determines which versions are made available.
If a list item appears both in an implicit and explicit list, the explicit
list determines which versions are made available.

\end{ccppspecific}

\begin{fortranspecific}
If a procedure is referenced in a procedure that appears as a list item in a \code{to}
clause on a \code{declare}~\code{target} directive then the name of the procedure is 
treated as if it had appeared in a \code{to} clause on a \code{declare}~\code{target}
directive.

If a \code{declare}~\code{target} does not have any clauses then an implicit
\plc{extended-list} to an implicit \code{to} clause of one item is formed from
the name of the enclosing subroutine subprogram, function subprogram or
interface body to which it applies.

If a \code{declare}~\code{target} directive has an \code{implements} or 
\code{device_type} clause then any enclosed internal procedures cannot contain 
any \code{declare}~\code{target} directives. The enclosing \code{device_type} 
clause implicitly applies to internal procedures.
