% When editing this file:
%
%    1. To change formatting, appearance, or style, please edit openmp.sty.
%
%    2. Custom commands and macros are defined in openmp.sty.
%
%    3. Be kind to other editors -- keep a consistent style by copying-and-pasting to
%       create new content.
%
%    4. We use semantic markup, e.g. (see openmp.sty for a full list):
%         \code{}     % for bold monospace keywords, code, operators, etc.
%         \plc{}      % for italic placeholder names, grammar, etc.
%
%    5. There are environments that provide special formatting, e.g. language bars.
%       Please use them whereever appropriate.  Examples are:
%
%         \begin{fortranspecific}
%         This is text that appears enclosed in blue language bars for Fortran.
%         \end{fortranspecific}
%
%         \begin{note}
%         This is a note.  The "Note -- " header appears automatically.
%         \end{note}
%
%    6. Other recommendations:
%         Use the convenience macros defined in openmp.sty for the minor headers
%         such as Comments, Syntax, etc.
%
%         To keep items together on the same page, prefer the use of
%         \begin{samepage}.... Avoid \parbox for text blocks as it interrupts line numbering.
%         When possible, avoid \filbreak, \pagebreak, \newpage, \clearpage unless that's
%         what you mean. Use \needspace{} cautiously for troublesome paragraphs.
%
%         Avoid absolute lengths and measures in this file; use relative units when possible.
%         Vertical space can be relative to \baselineskip or ex units. Horizontal space
%         can be relative to \linewidth or em units.
%
%         Prefer \emph{} to italicize terminology, e.g.:
%             This is a \emph{definition}, not a placeholder.
%             This is a \plc{var-name}.

\label{sec:if Clause}

\summary
The semantics of an \code{if} clause are described in the section on the
construct to which it applies.
The \code{if} clause \plc{directive-name-modifier} names the associated
construct to which an expression applies, and is particularly useful for
composite and combined constructs.

\clearpage  %% HACK
\syntax
\begin{ccppspecific}

The syntax of the \code{if} clause is as follows:

\begin{ompSyntax}
if(\plc{[ directive-name-modifier }:\plc{] scalar-expression})
\end{ompSyntax}
\end{ccppspecific}

\begin{fortranspecific}

The syntax of the \code{if} clause is as follows:

\begin{ompSyntax}
if(\plc{[ directive-name-modifier }:\plc{] scalar-logical-expression})
\end{ompSyntax}
\end{fortranspecific}

\descr
The effect of the \code{if} clause depends on the construct to
which it is applied. For combined or composite constructs, the
\code{if} clause only applies to the semantics of the construct
named in the \plc{directive-name-modifier} if one is specified.
If no  \plc{directive-name-modifier} is specified for a combined
or composite construct then the \code{if} clause applies to all
constructs to which an \code{if} clause can apply.
