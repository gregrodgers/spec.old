\index{memory spaces}

OpenMP memory spaces represent storage resources where variables can be stored 
and retrieved. Table~\ref{tab:Predefined Memory Spaces} shows the list of 
predefined memory spaces. The selection of a given memory space expresses 
an intent to use storage with certain traits for the allocations. The actual 
storage resources that each memory space represents are implementation defined.

\begin{note}
For variables allocated in the \scode{omp_const_mem_space} memory space OpenMP 
supports initializing constant memory either by means of the \code{firstprivate} 
clause or through initialization with compile time constants for static and 
constant variables. Implementation-defined mechanisms to provide the constant 
value of these variables may also be supported.

\subsection{Memory Allocators}
\label{subsec:Memory Allocators}
\index{memory allocators}

OpenMP memory allocators can be used by a program to make allocation requests. 
When a memory allocator receives a request to allocate storage of a certain size, 
an allocation of logically consecutive \emph{memory} in the resources of its 
associated memory space of at least the size that was requested will be returned
if possible. This allocation will not overlap with any other existing allocation 
from an OpenMP memory allocator. 

The behavior of the allocation process can be affected by the allocator traits 
that the user specifies. Table~\ref{tab:Allocator traits} shows the allowed allocators 
traits, their possible values and the default value of each trait.

The {\scode{sync_hint}} trait describes the expected manner in which multiple 
threads may use the allocator. The values and their description are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \scode{contended}: high contention is expected on the allocator; that 
      is, many threads are expected to request allocations simultaneously.
\item \scode{uncontended}: low contention is expected on the allocator; that 
      is, few threads are expected to request allocations simultaneously.
\item \scode{serialized}: only one thread at a time will request allocations 
      with the allocator. Requesting two allocations simultaneously when 
      specifying \scode{serialized} results in unspecified behavior.
\item \scode{private}: the same thread will request allocations with the 
      allocator every time. Requesting an allocation from different threads, 
      simultaneously or not, when specifying \scode{private} results in 
      unspecified behavior.
\end{itemize}

Allocated memory will be byte aligned to at least the value specified for the 
{\scode{alignment}} trait of the allocator. Some directives and API routines
can specify additional requirements on alignment beyond those described in 
this section.

Memory allocated by allocators with the \scode{access} trait defined to be 
\scode{all} must be accessible by all threads in the device where the allocation 
was requested. Memory allocated by allocators with the \scode{access} trait 
defined to be \scode{cgroup} will be memory accessible by all threads in the 
same contention group as the thread that requested the allocation. Attempts to 
access the memory returned by an allocator with the \scode{access} trait 
defined to be \scode{cgroup} from a thread that is not part of the same 
contention group as the thread that allocated the memory result in unspecified 
behavior. Memory allocated by allocators with the \scode{access} trait defined 
to be \scode{pteam} will be memory accessible by all threads that bind to the 
same {\scode{parallel}} region of the thread that requested the allocation. Attempts 
to access the memory returned by  an allocator with the \scode{access} trait 
defined to be \scode{pteam} from a thread that does not bind to the same 
{\scode{parallel}} region as the thread that allocated the memory result 
in unspecified behavior. Memory allocated by allocator with the \scode{access} 
trait defined to be \scode{thread} will be memory accessible by the {\splc{thread}} 
that requested the allocation. Attempts to access the memory returned by an allocator 
with the \scode{access} trait defined to be \scode{thread} from a thread other 
than the one that allocated the memory result in unspecified behavior.

The total amount of storage in bytes that an allocator can use is limited by 
the {\scode{pool_size}} trait. For allocators with the \scode{access} trait 
defined to be \scode{all}, this limit refers to allocations from all threads 
that access the allocator. For allocators with the \scode{access} trait defined 
to be \scode{cgroup}, this limit refers to allocations from threads that access
the allocator from the same contention group. For allocators with the 
\scode{access} trait defined to be \scode{pteam}, this limit refers to 
allocations from threads that access the allocator from the same parallel 
team. For allocators with the \scode{access} trait defined to be \scode{thread},
this limit refers to allocations from each thread that access the allocator. 
Requests that would result in using more storage than {\scode{pool_size}} 
will not be fulfilled by the allocator.

The \scode{fallback} trait specifies how the allocator behaves when it 
cannot fulfill an allocation request. If the \scode{fallback} trait is set 
to \scode{null_fb}, the allocator returns the value zero if it fails to 
allocate the memory. If the \scode{fallback} trait is set to \scode{abort_fb}, 
program execution will be terminated if the allocation fails. If the 
\scode{fallback} trait is set to \scode{allocator_fb} then when an allocation 
fails the request will be delegated to the allocator specified in the 
\scode{fb_data} trait. If the \scode{fallback} trait is set to 
\scode{default_mem_fb} then when an allocation fails another allocation 
will be tried in the \scode{omp_default_mem_space} memory space, which assumes
all allocator traits to be set to their default values except for 
\scode{fallback} trait which will be set to \scode{null_fb}.

Allocators with the \scode{pinned} trait defined to be \scode{true} 
ensure that their allocations remain in the same storage resource at 
the same location for their entire lifetime.

The {\scode{partition}} trait describes the partitioning of allocated
memory over the storage resources represented by the memory space associated
with the allocator. The partitioning will be done in parts with a minimum size
that is implementation defined. The values are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \scode{environment}: the placement of allocated memory is determined 
      by the execution environment.
\item \scode{nearest}: allocated memory is placed in the storage resource 
      that is nearest to the thread that requests the allocation.
\item \scode{blocked}: allocated memory is partitioned into parts of 
      approximately the same size with at most one part per storage resource.
\item \scode{interleaved}: allocated memory parts are distributed in a 
      round-robin fashion across the storage resources.
\end{itemize}

Table~\ref{tab:Predefined Allocators} shows the list of predefined memory 
allocators and their associated memory spaces. The predefined memory 
allocators have default values for their allocator traits unless otherwise specified.

\subsection{\hcode{allocate} Directive}
\index{allocate@{\code{allocate}}}
\index{directives!allocate@{\code{allocate}}}
\label{subsec:allocate Directive}
\summary

The \code{allocate} directive specifies how a set of variables are allocated. 
The \code{allocate} directive is a declarative directive if it is not associated 
with an allocation statement.

\syntax
\begin{ccppspecific}
The syntax of the \code{allocate} directive is as follows:

\begin{ompcPragma}
#pragma omp allocate(\plc{list}) \plc{[clause] new-line}
\end{ompcPragma}

where \plc{clause} is one of the following:

\begin{indentedcodelist}
allocator(\plc{allocator})
\end{indentedcodelist}

where \plc{allocator} is an expression of \code{omp_allocator_handle_t} type.

\end{ccppspecific}
\medskip

\begin{fortranspecific}
The syntax of the \code{allocate} directive is as follows:

\begin{ompfPragma}
!$omp allocate(\plc{list}) \plc{[clause]}
\end{ompfPragma}

or
\begin{ompfPragma}
!$omp allocate\plc{[}(\plc{list})\plc{] clause}
\plc{[}!$omp allocate(\plc{list}) \plc{clause}
\plc{[...]]}
   \plc{allocate statement}
\end{ompfPragma} %$ Close off misinterpreted dollar sign/math symbol

where \plc{clause} is one of the following:

\begin{indentedcodelist}
allocator(\plc{allocator})
\end{indentedcodelist}

where \plc{allocator} is an integer expression of \code{omp_allocator_handle_kind} \plc{kind}.

\end{fortranspecific}

\descr

If the directive is not associated with a statement, the storage for each 
\plc{list item} that appears in the directive will be provided by an allocation 
through a memory allocator. If no clause is specified then the memory allocator 
specified by the \plc{def-allocator-var} ICV will be used. If the \code{allocator} 
clause is specified, the memory allocator specified in the clause will be used. 
The allocation of each \plc{list item} 
will be byte aligned to at least the alignment required by the
base language for the type of that \plc{list item}.

The scope of this allocation is that of the list item in the base language. At 
the end of the scope for a given list item the memory allocator used to allocate 
that list item deallocates the storage.

\begin{fortranspecific}
If the directive is associated with an \plc{allocate statement}, the same list 
items appearing in the directive list and the \plc{allocate statement} list are 
allocated with the memory allocator of the directive. If no list items are 
specified then all variables listed in the \plc{allocate statement} are 
allocated with the memory allocator of the directive.
\end{fortranspecific}

For allocations that arise from this directive the \scode{null_fb} value of the 
fallback allocator trait will behave as if the \scode{abort_fb} had been specified.

\restrictions
\begin{itemize}
\item A variable that is part of another variable (as an array or structure 
      element) cannot appear in an \code{allocate} directive.
\item The \code{allocate} directive must appear in the same scope as the 
      declarations of each of its list items and must follow all such declarations.
\item At most one \code{allocator} clause can appear on the \code{allocate} directive.
\item \code{allocate} directives that appear in a \code{target} region must specify 
      an \code{allocator} clause unless a \code{requires} directive with the 
      \code{dynamic_allocators} clause is present in the same compilation unit.

\begin{ccppspecific}
\item If a list item has a static storage type, the \plc{allocator}
      expression in the \code{allocator} clause must be a constant
      expression that evaluates to one of the predefined memory allocator values.
\item After a \plc{list item} has been allocated, the scope that 
      contains the \code{allocate} directive must not end abnormally 
      other than through C++ exceptions, such as through a 
      call to the \code{longjmp} function.
\end{ccppspecific}

\begin{fortranspecific}
\item List items specified in the \code{allocate} directive must not have the 
      \code{ALLOCATABLE} attribute unless the directive is associated with an 
      \plc{allocate statement}.
\item List items specified in an \code{allocate} directive that is associated 
      with an \plc{allocate statement} must be variables that are allocated 
      by the \plc{allocate statement}.
\item Multiple directives can only be associated with an \plc{allocate 
      statement} if list items are specified on each \code{allocate} directive.
\item If a list item has the \code{SAVE} attribute, is a common block name, or 
      is declared in the scope of a module, then only predefined memory allocator 
      parameters can be used in the \code{allocator} clause.
\item A type parameter inquiry cannot appear in an \code{allocate} directive.

\subsection{\hcode{allocate} Clause}
\index{allocate@{\code{allocate}}}
\index{clauses!allocate@{\code{allocate}}}
\label{subsec:allocate Clause}
\summary
The \code{allocate} clause specifies the memory allocator to be used to 
obtain storage for private variables of a directive.

\syntax

The syntax of the \code{allocate} clause is as follows:

\begin{ompSyntax}
allocate(\plc{[allocator}:\plc{] list})
\end{ompSyntax}
\needspace{10\baselineskip}

\begin{ccppspecific}
where \plc{allocator} is an expression of the \code{omp_allocator_handle_t} type.
\end{ccppspecific}

\begin{fortranspecific}
where \plc{allocator} is an integer expression of the \code{omp_allocator_handle_kind} 
\plc{kind}.
\end{fortranspecific}

\descr

The storage for new list items that arise from list items that appear in the 
directive will be provided through a memory allocator. If an \plc{allocator} 
is specified in the clause, that allocator will be used for allocations. For 
all directives except the \code{target} directive, if no \plc{allocator} is 
specified in the clause then the memory allocator that is specified by the 
\plc{def-allocator-var} ICV will be used for the list items that are specified 
in the \code{allocate} clause. The allocation of each \plc{list item} 
will be byte aligned to at least the alignment required by the
base language for the type of that \plc{list item}.

For allocations that arise from this clause the \scode{null_fb} value of the 
fallback allocator trait will behave as if the \scode{abort_fb} had been specified.

\restrictions
\begin{itemize}
\item For any list item that is specified in the \code{allocate} clause on a 
      directive, a data-sharing attribute clause that may create a private copy 
      of that list item must be specified on the same directive.
\item For \code{task}, \code{taskloop} or \code{target} directives, allocation 
      requests to memory allocators with the trait \code{access} set to 
      \code{thread} result in unspecified behavior.
\item \code{allocate} clauses that appear on a \code{target} construct or on
      constructs in a \code{target} region must specify an \plc{allocator} 
      expression unless a \code{requires} directive with the \code{dynamic_allocators}
      clause is present in the same compilation unit.
