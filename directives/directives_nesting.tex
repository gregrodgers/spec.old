\index{nesting of regions}
This section describes a set of restrictions on the nesting of regions. The 
restrictions on nesting are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item A worksharing region may not be closely nested inside a worksharing,
      \code{loop}, \code{task}, \code{taskloop}, \code{critical}, \code{ordered},
      \code{atomic}, or \code{master} region.
\item A \code{barrier} region may not be closely nested inside a worksharing,
      \code{loop}, \code{task}, \code{taskloop}, \code{critical}, \code{ordered},
      \code{atomic}, or \code{master} region.
\item A \code{master} region may not be closely nested inside a worksharing,
      \code{loop}, \code{atomic}, \code{task}, or \code{taskloop} region.
\item An \code{ordered} region corresponding to an \code{ordered} construct
      without any clause or with the \code{threads} or \code{depend} clause 
      may not be closely nested inside a \code{critical}, \code{ordered}, 
      \code{loop}, \code{atomic}, \code{task}, or \code{taskloop} region.
\item An \code{ordered} region corresponding to an \code{ordered} construct 
      without the \code{simd} clause specified must be closely nested inside 
      a worksharing-loop region.
\item An \code{ordered} region corresponding to an \code{ordered} construct 
      with the \code{simd} clause specified must be closely nested inside a 
      \code{simd} or worksharing-loop SIMD region.
\item An \code{ordered} region corresponding to an \code{ordered} construct 
      with both the \code{simd} and \code{threads} clauses must be closely 
      nested inside a worksharing-loop SIMD region or closely nested inside 
      a worksharing-loop and \code{simd} region.
\item A \code{critical} region may not be nested (closely or otherwise) inside 
      a \code{critical} region with the same name. This restriction is not 
      sufficient to prevent deadlock.
\item OpenMP constructs may not be encountered during execution of an
      \code{atomic} region.
\item The only OpenMP constructs that can be encountered during execution of a
      \code{simd} (or worksharing-loop SIMD) region are the \code{atomic} construct,
      the \code{loop} construct, the \code{simd} construct and the \code{ordered} 
      construct with the \code{simd} clause.
\item If a \code{target}~\code{update}, \code{target}~\code{data},
      \code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data}, or
      \code{target}~\code{exit}~\code{data} construct is encountered during
      execution of a \code{target} region, the behavior is unspecified.
\item If a \code{target} construct is encountered during execution of a
      \code{target} region and a \code{device} clause in which the 
      \code{ancestor} \plc{device-modifier} appears is not present on 
      the construct, the behavior is unspecified.
\item A \code{teams} region can only be strictly nested within the implicit 
      parallel region or a \code{target} region. If a \code{teams} construct 
      is nested within a \code{target} construct, that \code{target} construct 
      must contain no statements, declarations or directives outside of the 
      \code{teams} construct.
\item \code{distribute}, \code{distribute simd}, distribute parallel 
      worksharing-loop, distribute parallel worksharing-loop SIMD, \code{loop}, 
      \code{parallel} regions, including any \code{parallel} regions arising 
      from combined constructs, \code{omp_get_num_teams()} regions, and 
      \code{omp_get_team_num()} regions are the only OpenMP regions
      that may be strictly nested inside the \code{teams} region.
\item The region corresponding to the \code{distribute} construct must be
      strictly nested inside a \code{teams} region.
\item If \plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{taskgroup}, the \code{cancel}
      construct must be closely nested inside a \code{task} construct and the
      \code{cancel} region must be closely nested inside a \code{taskgroup} 
      region. If \plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{sections}, the 
      \code{cancel} construct must be closely nested inside a \code{sections} 
      or \code{section} construct. Otherwise, the \code{cancel} construct must 
      be closely nested inside an OpenMP construct that matches the type 
      specified in \plc{construct-type-clause} of the \code{cancel} construct.
\item A \code{cancellation}~\code{point} construct for which
      \plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{taskgroup} must be closely nested
      inside a \code{task} construct, and the \code{cancellation}~\code{point}
      region must be closely nested inside a \code{taskgroup} region. A
      \code{cancellation}~\code{point} construct for which
      \plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{sections} must be closely nested
      inside a \code{sections} or \code{section} construct. Otherwise, a
      \code{cancellation}~\code{point} construct must be closely nested inside
      an OpenMP construct that matches the type specified in
      \plc{construct-type-clause}.
\item The only constructs that may be nested inside a \code{loop} region
      are the \code{loop} construct, the \code{parallel} construct, the
      \code{simd} construct, and combined constructs for which the first
      construct is a \code{parallel} construct.
\item A \code{loop} region may not contain calls to procedures that contain 
      OpenMP directives or calls to the OpenMP Runtime API.
\end{itemize}
