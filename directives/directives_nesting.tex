\index{nesting of regions}
This section describes a set of restrictions on the nesting of regions. The restrictions on 
nesting are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item A worksharing region may not be closely nested inside a worksharing, \code{task}, \code{taskloop},
\code{critical}, \code{ordered}, \code{atomic}, or \code{master} region.

\item A \code{barrier} region may not be closely nested inside a worksharing, \code{task}, \code{taskloop},
\code{critical}, \code{ordered}, \code{atomic}, or \code{master} region.

\item A \code{master} region may not be closely nested inside a worksharing,
\code{atomic}, \code{task}, or \code{taskloop} region.

\item An \code{ordered} region arising from an \code{ordered} construct without
any clause or with the \code{threads} or \code{depend} clause may not be closely
nested inside a \code{critical}, \code{ordered}, \code{atomic}, \code{task},
or \code{taskloop} region. 

\item An \code{ordered} region arising from an \code{ordered} construct without
any clause or with the \code{threads} or \code{depend} clause must be closely nested
inside a loop region (or parallel loop region) with an \code{ordered} clause.

\item An \code{ordered} region arising from an \code{ordered} construct with the
\code{simd} clause must be closely nested inside a \code{simd} (or loop SIMD)
region.

\item An \code{ordered} region arising from an \code{ordered} construct with
  both the \code{simd} and \code{threads} clauses must be closely nested inside
  a loop SIMD region.

\item A \code{critical} region may not be nested (closely or otherwise) inside a \code{critical} 
region with the same name. This restriction is not sufficient to prevent 
deadlock.

\item OpenMP constructs may not be encountered during execution of an
\code{atomic} region.

\item An \code{ordered} construct with the \code{simd} clause is the only OpenMP
construct that can be encountered during execution of a \code{simd}
region.

\item If a \code{target}, \code{target}~\code{update}, 
\code{target}~\code{data}, \code{target}~\code{enter}~\code{data}, or 
\code{target}~\code{exit}~\code{data} construct is encountered during
execution of a \code{target} region, the behavior is unspecified.

\item If specified, a \code{teams} construct must be contained within a \code{target} construct. That 
\code{target} construct must not contain any statements or directives outside of the \code{teams} 
construct. 

\item \code{distribute}, \code{distribute simd}, distribute parallel loop,
distribute parallel loop SIMD, and \code{parallel} regions, including any
\code{parallel} regions arising from combined constructs, are the only OpenMP regions
that may be strictly nested inside the \code{teams} region.

\item The region associated with the \code{distribute} construct must be
strictly nested inside a \code{teams} region.

\item If \plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{taskgroup}, the \code{cancel}
construct must be closely nested inside a \code{task} construct and the
\code{cancel} region must be closely nested inside a \code{taskgroup} region. If
\plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{sections}, the \code{cancel} construct
must be closely nested inside a \code{sections} or \code{section} construct.
Otherwise, the \code{cancel} construct must be closely
nested inside an OpenMP construct that matches the type specified in
\plc{construct-type-clause} of the \code{cancel} construct.

\item A \code{cancellation}~\code{point} construct for which
\plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{taskgroup} must be closely nested
inside a \code{task} construct, and the \code{cancellation}~\code{point}
region must be closely nested inside a \code{taskgroup} region. A
\code{cancellation}~\code{point} construct for which
\plc{construct-type-clause} is \code{sections} must be closely nested
inside a \code{sections} or \code{section} construct. Otherwise, a
\code{cancellation}~\code{point} construct must be closely nested inside
an OpenMP construct that matches the type specified in
\plc{construct-type-clause}.

\end{itemize}
