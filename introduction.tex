The collection of compiler directives, library routines, and environment
variables described in this document collectively define the specification of
the OpenMP Application Program Interface (OpenMP API) for parallelism in C, C++
and Fortran programs.

This specification provides a model for parallel programming that is portable
across architectures from different vendors. Compilers from numerous vendors
support the OpenMP API. More information about the OpenMP API can be found at
the following web site

\code{http://www.openmp.org}

The directives, library routines, environment variables, and tool support
defined in this document allow users to create, to manage, to debug and to
analyze parallel programs while permitting portability. The directives extend
the C, C++ and Fortran base languages with single program multiple
data (SPMD) constructs, tasking constructs, device constructs, worksharing
constructs, and synchronization constructs, and they provide support for
sharing, mapping and privatizing data. The functionality to control the
runtime environment is provided by library routines and environment
variables. Compilers that support the OpenMP API often include command line
options to enable or to disable interpretation of OpenMP directives.
