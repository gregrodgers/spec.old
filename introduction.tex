% This is introduction.tex (Chapter 1 )of the OpenMP specification
% This is an included file. See the master file for more information.
%
% When editing this file:
%
%    1. To change formatting, appearance, or style, please edit openmp.sty.
%
%    2. Custom commands and macros are defined in openmp.sty.
%
%    3. Be kind to other editors -- keep a consistent style by copying-and-pasting to
%       create new content.
%
%    4. We use semantic markup, e.g. (see openmp.sty for a full list):
%         \code{}     % for bold monospace keywords, code, operators, etc.
%         \plc{}      % for italic placeholder names, grammar, etc.
%
%    5. There are environments that provide special formatting, e.g. language bars.
%       Please use them whereever appropriate.  Examples are:
%
%         \begin{fortranspecific}
%         This is text that appears enclosed in blue language bars for Fortran.
%         \end{fortranspecific}
%
%         \begin{note}
%         This is a note.  The "Note -- " header appears automatically.
%         \end{note}
%
%    6. Other recommendations:
%         Use the convenience macros defined in openmp.sty for the minor headers
%         such as Comments, Syntax, etc.
%
%         To keep items together on the same page, prefer the use of
%         \begin{samepage}.... Avoid \parbox for text blocks as it interrupts line numbering.
%         When possible, avoid \filbreak, \pagebreak, \newpage, \clearpage unless that's
%         what you mean. Use \needspace{} cautiously for troublesome paragraphs.
%
%         Avoid absolute lengths and measures in this file; use relative units when possible.
%         Vertical space can be relative to \baselineskip or ex units. Horizontal space
%         can be relative to \linewidth or em units.
%
%         Prefer \emph{} to italicize terminology, e.g.:
%             This is a \emph{definition}, not a placeholder.
%             This is a \plc{var-name}.

\label{chap:introduction}
The collection of compiler directives, library routines, and environment
variables described in this document collectively define the specification of
the OpenMP Application Program Interface (OpenMP API) for parallelism in C, C++
and Fortran programs.

This specification provides a model for parallel programming that is portable
across architectures from different vendors. Compilers from numerous vendors
support the OpenMP API. More information about the OpenMP API can be found at
the following web site

\code{http://www.openmp.org}

The directives, library routines, environment variables, and tool support 
defined in this document allow users to create, to manage, to debug and to 
analyze parallel programs while permitting portability. The directives extend 
the C, C++ and Fortran base languages with single program multiple
data (SPMD) constructs, tasking constructs, device constructs, worksharing 
constructs,and synchronization constructs, and they provide support for 
sharing, mapping and privatizing data. The functionality to control the 
runtime environment is provided by library routines and environment 
variables. Compilers that support the OpenMP API often include a command 
line option to the compiler that activates and allows interpretation of
all OpenMP directives.
