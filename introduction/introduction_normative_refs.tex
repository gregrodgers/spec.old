While future versions of the OpenMP specification are expected to
address the following features, currently their use may result in
unspecified behavior.

\begin{itemize}
\item DO CONCURRENT
\item Allocatable components of recursive type
\item Simply contiguous arrays rank remapping to rank>1 target
\item Polymorphic assignment
\item Accessing real and imaginary parts
\item Pointer function reference is a variable
\item The BLOCK construct
\item Internal procedure as an actual argument
\item Generic resolution by procedureness
\item Generic resolution by pointer vs. allocatable
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

Where this OpenMP API specification refers to C, C++ or Fortran, reference is made to
the base language supported by the implementation.
