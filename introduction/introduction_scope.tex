The OpenMP API covers only user-directed parallelization, wherein the 
programmer explicitly specifies the actions to be taken by the compiler 
and runtime system in order to execute the program in parallel. 
OpenMP-compliant implementations are not required to check for data 
dependencies, data conflicts, race conditions, or deadlocks, any of
which may occur in conforming programs. In addition, compliant 
implementations are not required to check for code sequences that 
cause a program to be classified as non-conforming. Application 
developers are responsible for correctly using the OpenMP API
to produce a conforming program. The OpenMP API does not cover 
compiler-generated automatic parallelization.
