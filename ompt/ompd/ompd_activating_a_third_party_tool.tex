\section{Activating an OMPD Tool}
\label{subsec:activating}

The tool and the OpenMP program exist as separate processes. 
Thus, coordination is required between the OpenMP runtime
and the external tool for OMPD.

\subsection{Enabling the Runtime for OMPD}
\label{subsubsec:enabling-ompd}

In order to support third-party tools, the OpenMP runtime may need to collect
and to maintain information that it might not otherwise. The OpenMP runtime 
collects whatever information is necessary to support OMPD if the environment 
variable \code{OMP_DEBUG} is set to \plc{enabled}.
