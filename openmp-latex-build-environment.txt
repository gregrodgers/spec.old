The OpenMP LaTeX documents can be built using standard LaTeX tools. Instructions for
installing LaTex on Windows, Mac, and Linux can be found here:

     http://latex-project.org/ftp.html

A Makefile is provided that illustrates the commands for building a PDF file. Basically,
it involves executing:

     pdflatex openmp.tex

which produces several intermediate files, followed by:

     makeindex -s openmp-index.ist openmp.idx

to produce the index files, and finally another pass of:

     pdflatex openmp.tex

to produce the final PDF output.

This has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and kubuntu 14.04, using the standard LaTex packages
available through the default package manager.
