% When editing this file:
%
%    1. To change formatting, appearance, or style, please edit openmp.sty.
%
%    2. Custom commands and macros are defined in openmp.sty.
%
%    3. Be kind to other editors -- keep a consistent style by copying-and-pasting to
%       create new content.
%
%    4. We use semantic markup, e.g. (see openmp.sty for a full list):
%         \code{}     % for bold monospace keywords, code, operators, etc.
%         \plc{}      % for italic placeholder names, grammar, etc.
%
%    5. Other recommendations:
%         Use the convenience macros defined in openmp.sty for the minor headers
%         such as Comments, Syntax, etc.
%
%         To keep items together on the same page, prefer the use of
%         \begin{samepage}.... Avoid \parbox for text blocks as it interrupts line numbering.
%         When possible, avoid \filbreak, \pagebreak, \newpage, \clearpage unless that's
%         what you mean. Use \needspace{} cautiously for troublesome paragraphs.
%
%         Avoid absolute lengths and measures in this file; use relative units when possible.
%         Vertical space can be relative to \baselineskip or ex units. Horizontal space
%         can be relative to \linewidth or em units.
%
%         Prefer \emph{} to italicize terminology, e.g.:
%             This is a \emph{definition}, not a placeholder.
%             This is a \plc{var-name}.

\newcommand{\devicedesc}{
The \callbackarg{} \plc{device} is a pointer to an opaque object that
represents the target device instance. The pointer to the device
instance object is used by functions in the device tracing interface
to identify the device being addressed.

\newcommand{\epdesc}{
The \callbackarg{} \plc{endpoint} indicates whether the callback is
signalling the beginning or the end of a scope.
}

\newcommand\codeptrdesc{
The \callbackarg{} \plc{codeptr\_ra} is used to relate the implementation
of an OpenMP region back to its source code.  In cases where a runtime
routine implements the region associated with this callback,
\plc{codeptr\_ra} is expected to contain the return address of the
call to the runtime routine.  In cases where the implementation of
this feature is inlined, \plc{codeptr\_ra} is expected to contain the
return address of the invocation of this callback.  In cases where
attribution to source code is impossible or inappropriate,
\plc{codeptr\_ra} may be \code{NULL}.

\chapter{Tool Support}
\index{tool support}
\label{chap:ToolsSupport}

%To enable development of high-quality, portable, \emph{first-party} tools
%that support monitoring and performance analysis of OpenMP programs
%developed using any implementation of the OpenMP API, the OpenMP API
%includes a tool interface known as OMPT. 

This chapter describes OMPT---a tool interface for the OpenMP API.
The chapter begins with an overview of the OMPT interface in
Section~\ref{sec:ompt-overview}. Next,
it describes how to initialize (Section~\ref{sec:ompt-initialization})
and finalize (Sections~\ref{sec:ompt-finalization}) a tool.
Subsequent sections describe details of the interface, including
data types shared between an OpenMP implementation and a tool
(Section~\ref{sec:ompt-data-types}), 
an interface that enables an OpenMP implementation to determine that a
tool is available (Section~\ref{sec:tool-interface}),
type signatures for tool callbacks 
that an OpenMP implementation may dispatch for OpenMP events
(Section~\ref{sec:ompt-tool-callbacks}), and 
\emph{runtime entry points}---function interfaces
provided by an OpenMP implementation for use by a tool
(Section~\ref{sec:entry-points}).
