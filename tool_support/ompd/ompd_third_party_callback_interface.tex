\subsection{OMPD Tool Callback Interface}
\label{subsec:ompd-tool-callback-interface}

In order for the OMPD library to provide information about the internal state
of the OpenMP runtime system in an OpenMP process or core file,
it must have a means to extract information from
the OpenMP process that the tool is debugging.
The OpenMP process that the tool is operating on may be either a ``live'' process or a core file,
and a thread may be either a ``live'' thread in an OpenMP process,
or a thread in a core file.
In order to enable the OMPD library to extract state information from an OpenMP process or core file,
the tool must supply the OMPD library with callback functions to inquire
about the size of primitive types in the device of the OpenMP process,
look up the addresses of symbols,
as well as read and write memory in the device.
The OMPD library then uses these callbacks to implement its interface operations.
The OMPD library will only call the callback functions in direct response
to calls made by the tool to the OMPD library.
Signatures for the tool callbacks used by the OMPD library are given below.


\subsubsection{Memory Management of OMPD Library}
The OMPD library must not access the heap manager directly. Instead, if it needs heap memory it
must use the memory allocation and deallocation callback functions that are described in this
section, \code{ompd_callback_memory_alloc_fn_t} (see~\specref{subsubsubsec:ompd_callback_memory_alloc_fn_t})
and 
\code{ompd_callback_memory_free_fn_t} (see~\specref{subsubsubsec:ompd_callback_memory_free_fn_t}),
which are
provided by the tool to obtain and release heap memory. This will ensure that the library does not
interfere with any custom memory management scheme that the tool may use.

If the OMPD library is implemented in \code{C++}, memory management operators like \code{new}
and \code{delete} in all their variants, \emph{must all} be overloaded and implemented in terms of
the callbacks provided by the tool. The OMPD library must be coded so that any of its
definitions of \code{new} or \code{delete} do not interfere with any defined by the tool.

In some cases, the OMPD library will need to allocate memory to return results to the
tool. This memory will then be `owned' by the tool, which will be responsible for releasing it. It is
therefore vital that the OMPD library and the tool use the same memory manager.

OMPD handles are created by the OMPD library. These are opaque to the
tool, and depending on the specific implementation of OMPD may have complex
internal structure. The tool cannot know whether the handle pointers returned by the API
correspond to discrete heap allocations. Consequently, the tool must not simply deallocate a
handle by passing an address it receives from the OMPD library to its own memory manager.
Instead, the API includes functions that the tool must use when it no longer needs a handle.

Contexts are created by a tool and passed to the OMPD library. The OMPD
library does not need to release contexts; instead this will be done by the tool after it releases any
handles that may be referencing the contexts.

\descr

This callback maps a thread identifier within the address

can use the thread context, for example, to access
thread local storage (TLS).

\argdesc

The input argument \plc{address_space_context} is an opaque handle provided by the tool
to reference an address space.
The input arguments \plc{kind},  \plc{sizeof_thread_id}, and \plc{thread_id} represent a thread identifier.
On return the output argument \plc{thread_context} provides an opaque handle to the OMPD library

\subsubsection{Accessing Memory in the OpenMP Program or Runtime}

The OMPD library may need to read from, or write to, the OpenMP program.
It cannot do this directly, but instead must use the callbacks provided
to it by the tool, which will perform the operation
on its behalf.

  const char *\plc{symbol_name},
  ompd_address_t *\plc{symbol_addr},
  const char *\plc{file_name}
);
\end{ompSyntax}
\end{cspecific}

\descr
This callback function may be called by the OMPD library to look up
addresses of symbols within an specified address space of the tool.

\argdesc
This callback looks up the symbol provided in \plc{symbol_name}.

The \plc{address_space_context} input parameter is the tool's representation of the address 
space of the process, core file, or device. The use of a NULL \plc{address_space_context}
results in unspecified behavior.

The \plc{thread_context} is an optional input parameter which should be NULL for global memory 
access. If  \plc{thread_context} is not NULL, it gives the thread specific context for the symbol 
lookup, for the purpose of calculating thread local storage~(TLS) addresses.
If the \plc{thread_context} parameter is not NULL, the thread that the \plc{thread_context} 
argument refers to must be associated either to the process or to the device that corresponds to 
the \plc{address_space_context} argument.

The \plc{symbol_name} supplied by the OMPD library is used verbatim by the tool
and, in particular, 
no name mangling, demangling or other transformations are performed prior to the lookup.
The \plc{symbol_name} parameter must correspond to a statically allocated symbol within the 
specified address space. The symbol can correspond to any type of object, such as a variable, 
thread local storage variable, function, or untyped label. The symbol must be defined and can have 
a local, global, or weak binding.

The \plc{file_name} parameter is an optional input parameter that indicates the 
name of the shared library where the symbol is defined, and is intended to help the third party tool 
disambiguate symbols that are defined multiple times across the executable or shared library files. 
The shared library name may not be an exact match for the name seen by the tool. If the 
\plc{file_name} parameter is NULL, the tool will try first finding the symbol in the executable file, 
and, if the symbol is not found, the tool will try finding the symbol in the shared libraries in the order 
in which the shared libraries are loaded into the address space. If the \plc{file_name} parameter is 
not NULL, the tool will try first finding the symbol in the libraries that match the name in the 
\plc{file_name} parameter, and, if the symbol is not found, the tool will find the symbol following
the procedure as if the \plc{file_name} parameter is NULL.

The callback does not support finding symbols that are dynamically allocated on the call 
stack, or statically allocated symbols defined within the scope of a function or subroutine.

The callback returns the address of the symbol in \plc{*symbol_addr}.

At most \plc{nbytes} bytes are copied. 
If there  is no null byte among the first \plc{nbytes} bytes, the string placed in 
\plc{buffer} will not be null-terminated.

specific context for the memory access for the purpose of accessing
thread local storage (TLS).

The data are returned through \plc{buffer}, which is allocated and
owned by the OMPD library.
The contents of the buffer are unstructured, raw bytes.
It is the responsibility of the OMPD library to arrange for
any transformations such as byte-swapping that may be necessary
(see~\specref{subsubsubsec:ompd_callback_device_host_fn_t}) to interpret the
data returned.

\descr
The set of callbacks the OMPD library should use is collected
in the \code{ompd_callbacks_t} record structure.
An instance of this type is passed to the OMPD library
as a parameter to \code{ompd_initialize} (see~\specref{subsubsubsec:ompd_initialize}).
Each field points to a function that the OMPD library should use
for interacting with the OpenMP program, or getting memory from
the tool.

The \plc{alloc_memory} and \plc{free_memory} fields are
pointers to functions the OMPD library uses to allocate and release
dynamic memory.

\plc{print_string} points to a function that prints a string.

The architectures or programming models of the OMPD library and
party tool may be different from that of the OpenMP
program being examined.
\plc{sizeof_type} points to function that allows
the OMPD library to determine the sizes of the basic integer
and pointer types used by the OpenMP program.
Because of the differences in architecture or programming model,
the conventions for representing data in the OMPD library and
the OpenMP program may be different.
The \plc{device_to_host} field points to a function which translates
data from the conventions used by the OpenMP program to that used
by the tool and OMPD library.
The reverse operation is performed by the function pointed
to by the \plc{host_to_device} field.

The OMPD library may need to access memory in the OpenMP program.
The \plc{symbol_addr_lookup} field points to a callback the
OMPD library can use to find the address of a global or thread
local storage (TLS) symbol.
The \plc{read_memory}, \plc{write_memory} and \plc{read_string} fields are
pointers to functions for reading from, and writing to, global or TLS
memory in the OpenMP program, respectively.

\plc{get_thread_context_for_thread_id} is a pointer to a function
the OMPD library can use to obtain a thread context that corresponds to
a thread identifier.
