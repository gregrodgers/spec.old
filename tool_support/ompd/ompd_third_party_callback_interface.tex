\subsection{OMPD Tool Callback Interface}
\label{subsec:ompd-tool-callback-interface}

For the OMPD library to provide information about the internal state of the 
OpenMP runtime system in an OpenMP process or core file, it must have a means 
to extract information from the OpenMP process that the tool is debugging.
The OpenMP process on which the tool is operating may be either a ``live'' 
process or a core file, and a thread may be either a ``live'' thread in an 
OpenMP process, or a thread in a core file. To enable the OMPD library to 
extract state information from an OpenMP process or core file, the tool must 
supply the OMPD library with callback functions to inquire about the size of 
primitive types in the device of the OpenMP process, to look up the addresses 
of symbols, and to read and to write memory in the device. The OMPD library 
uses these callbacks to implement its interface operations. The OMPD library 
only invokes the callback functions in direct response to calls made by the 
tool to the OMPD library.



\subsubsection{Memory Management of OMPD Library}
The OMPD library must not access the heap manager directly. Instead, if it 
needs heap memory it must use the memory allocation and deallocation callback 
functions that are described in this section, 
\code{ompd_callback_memory_alloc_fn_t} 
(see \specref{subsubsubsec:ompd_callback_memory_alloc_fn_t}) and 
\code{ompd_callback_memory_free_fn_t} 
(see \specref{subsubsubsec:ompd_callback_memory_free_fn_t}), which are
provided by the tool to obtain and to release heap memory. This mechanism
ensures that the library does not interfere with any custom memory management 
scheme that the tool may use.

If the OMPD library is implemented in C++, memory management operators like 
\code{new} and \code{delete} in all their variants, \emph{must all} be overloaded 
and implemented in terms of the callbacks that the tool provides. The OMPD 
library must be coded so that any of its definitions of \code{new} or 
\code{delete} do not interfere with any that the tool defines.

In some cases, the OMPD library must allocate memory to return results to the 
tool. The tool then owns this memory and has the responsibility to release
it. Thus, the OMPD library and the tool must use the same memory manager.

The OMPD library creates OMPD handles, which are opaque to the tool and may have 
a complex internal structure. The tool cannot determine if the handle pointers 
that the API returns correspond to discrete heap allocations. Thus, the tool must 
not simply deallocate a handle by passing an address that it receives from the 
OMPD library to its own memory manager. Instead, the API includes functions that 
the tool must use when it no longer needs a handle.

A tool creates contexts and passes them to the OMPD library. The OMPD library 
does not release contexts; instead the tool release them after it releases any 
handles that may reference the contexts.

signature of the context mapping callback routine that the tool provides. This 
callback maps a thread identifier to a tool thread context. The thread identifier 
is within the address space that \plc{address_space_context} identifies. The OMPD 
library can use the thread context, for example, to access thread local storage.

\argdesc

\subsubsection{Accessing Memory in the OpenMP Program or Runtime}

The OMPD library may need to read from or to write to the OpenMP program.
It cannot do this directly. Instead the OMPD library must use callbacks 
that the tool provides so that the tool performs the operation.

\subsubsubsection{\hcode{ompd_callback_symbol_addr_fn_t}}
\label{subsubsubsec:ompd_callback_symbol_addr_fn_t}

\summary
The \code{ompd_callback_symbol_addr_fn_t} type is the type signature of the 
callback that the tool provides to look up the addresses of symbols in an 
OpenMP program.

  const char *\plc{symbol_name},
  ompd_address_t *\plc{symbol_addr},
  const char *\plc{file_name}
);
\end{ompSyntax}
\end{cspecific}

\descr
The \code{ompd_callback_symbol_addr_fn_t} is the type signature of the 
symbol-address query callback routine that the tool provides. This callback 
looks up addresses of symbols within a specified address space.

\argdesc
This callback looks up the symbol provided in the \plc{symbol_name} argument.

The \plc{address_space_context} argument is the tool's representation of the 
address space of the process, core file, or device.

The \plc{thread_context} argument is NULL for global memory access. If  
\plc{thread_context} is not NULL, \plc{thread_context} gives the thread specific 
context for the symbol lookup, for the purpose of calculating thread local 
storage addresses. If \plc{thread_context} is non-null then the thread 
to which \plc{thread_context} refers must be associated with either the process 
or the device that corresponds to the \plc{address_space_context} argument.

The tool uses the \plc{symbol_name} argument that the OMPD library supplies 
verbatim. In particular, no name mangling, demangling or other transformations 
are performed prior to the lookup. The \plc{symbol_name} parameter must correspond
to a statically allocated symbol within the specified address space. The symbol 
can correspond to any type of object, such as a variable, thread local storage 
variable, function, or untyped label. The symbol can have a local, global, or 
weak binding.

The \plc{file_name} argumentr is an optional input parameter that indicates the 
name of the shared library in which the symbol is defined, and is intended to 
help the third party tool disambiguate symbols that are defined multiple times 
across the executable or shared library files. The shared library name may not 
be an exact match for the name seen by the tool. If \plc{file_name} is NULL then
the tool first tries to find the symbol in the executable file, and, if the 
symbol is not found, the tool tries to find the symbol in the shared libraries 
in the order in which the shared libraries are loaded into the address space. 
If \plc{file_name} is non-null then the tool first tries to find the symbol in 
the libraries that match the name in the \plc{file_name} argument and, if the 
symbol is not found, the tool then uses the same procedure as when 
\plc{file_name} is NULL.

The callback does not support finding symbols that are dynamically allocated on 
the call stack, or statically allocated symbols that are defined within the scope 
of a function or subroutine.

The callback returns the symbol's address in the location to which
\plc{symbol_addr} points.

\restrictions
Routines that use the \code{ompd_callback_symbol_addr_fn_t} type have
the following restrictions:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \plc{address_space_context} argument must be non-null.
\item The symbol that the \plc{symbol_name} argument specifies must be defined.

\descr
The \code{ompd_callback_memory_read_fn_t} is the type signature of the read 
callback routines that the tool provides. 

The \code{read_memory} callback copies a block of data from \plc{addr} within 
the address space to the tool \plc{buffer}. 

The \code{read_string} callback copies a string to which \plc{addr} points, 
including the terminating null byte (\code{'\0'}), to the tool \plc{buffer}. 
At most \plc{nbytes} bytes are copied. If a null byte is not among the first 
\plc{nbytes} bytes, the string placed in \plc{buffer} is not null-terminated.

\argdesc
The address from which the data are to be read from the OpenMP program
specified by \plc{address_space_context} is given by \plc{addr}. while
\plc{nbytes} gives the number of bytes to be transfered. The \plc{thread_context} 
argument is optional for global memory access, and in this case should be NULL.
If it is non-null, \plc{thread_context} identifies the thread specific context 
for the memory access for the purpose of accessing thread local storage.

The data are returned through \plc{buffer}, which is allocated and owned by 
the OMPD library. The contents of the buffer are unstructured, raw bytes. The
OMPD library must arrange for any transformations such as byte-swapping that 
may be necessary (see~\specref{subsubsubsec:ompd_callback_device_host_fn_t}) 
to interpret the data.

\subsubsection{Data Format Conversion}
\label{subsubsec:data-format-conversion}

The architecuture and/or programming-model of the tool and
OMPD library may be different from that of the OpenMP program being

Consequently, the conventions for representing data will differ.
The callback interface includes operations for converting between
the conventions, such as byte order (`endianness'),

\descr
The set of callbacks the OMPD library should use is collected
in the \code{ompd_callbacks_t} record structure.
An instance of this type is passed to the OMPD library
as a parameter to \code{ompd_initialize} (see~\specref{subsubsubsec:ompd_initialize}).
Each field points to a function that the OMPD library should use
for interacting with the OpenMP program, or getting memory from
the tool.

The \plc{alloc_memory} and \plc{free_memory} fields are
pointers to functions the OMPD library uses to allocate and release
dynamic memory.

\plc{print_string} points to a function that prints a string.

The architectures or programming models of the OMPD library and
third party tool may be different from that of the OpenMP
program being examined.
\plc{sizeof_type} points to function that allows
the OMPD library to determine the sizes of the basic integer
and pointer types used by the OpenMP program.
Because of the differences in architecture or programming model,
the conventions for representing data in the OMPD library and
the OpenMP program may be different.
The \plc{device_to_host} field points to a function which translates
data from the conventions used by the OpenMP program to that used
by the tool and OMPD library.
The reverse operation is performed by the function pointed
to by the \plc{host_to_device} field.

The OMPD library may need to access memory in the OpenMP program.
The \plc{symbol_addr_lookup} field points to a callback that the
OMPD library can use to find the address of a global or thread
local storage (TLS) symbol.
The \plc{read_memory}, \plc{write_memory} and \plc{read_string} fields are
pointers to functions for reading from, and writing to, global or TLS
memory in the OpenMP program, respectively.

\plc{get_thread_context_for_thread_id} is a pointer to a function
that the OMPD library can use to obtain a thread context that corresponds to
a thread identifier.
