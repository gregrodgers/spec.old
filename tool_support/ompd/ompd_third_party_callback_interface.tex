\subsection{OMPD Tool Callback Interface}
\label{sec:ompd:ompd-tool-callback-interface}

For the OMPD plugin to provide information about the internal state
of the OpenMP runtime system in an OpenMP process or core file,
it must have a means to extract information from
the OpenMP process that the tool is debugging.
The OpenMP process that the tool is operating on may be either a ``live'' process or a core file,
and a thread may be either a ``live'' thread in an OpenMP process,
or a thread in a core file.
To enable OMPD to extract state information from an OpenMP process or core file,
the tool must supply the OMPD with callback functions to inquire
about the size of primitive types in the device of the OpenMP process,
look up the addresses of symbols,
as well as read and write memory in the device.
OMPD then uses these callbacks to implement its interface operations.
Signatures for the tool callbacks used by OMPD are given below.

\subsubsection{Memory Management}

The OMPD plugin \emph{must} obtain and release heap memory \emph{only}
using the callbacks provided to it by the tool.
It must \emph{not} call the heap manager directly using \code{malloc}.
For C++ implementations of OMPD this means that \code{new},
\code{new(throw)}, \code{new[]}, \code{delete}, \code{delete(throw)},
and \code{delete[]} in \emph{all} their variants \emph{must} be overloaded,
and implemented in terms of the callback functions
provided to it by the tool.

\subsubsubsection{Memory Allocation Callback}
\label{sec:ompd:ompd_memory_alloc_fn_t}
\index{ompd\_memory\_alloc\_fn\_t@{\code{ompd\_memory\_alloc\_fn\_t}}}

\summary
The type signature of the callback routine provided by the tool
to be used by the OMPD plugin to allocate memory.

\vbox{
% the odd-looking spacing between type and argument name ensures

\cspecificstart
\begin{boxedcode}
typedef ompd\_rc\_t (*ompd\_memory\_alloc\_fn\_t) (
  ompd\_size\_t   \plc{nbytes},
  void        **\plc{ptr}
);
\end{boxedcode}
\cspecificend
}

\argdesc
The argument \plc{nbytes} gives the size in bytes of the block of memory the
OMPD wants allocated.

On success, the tool returns \code{ompd\_rc\_ok} as the
return value of the callback, and the address of the newly allocated
block in \plc{*ptr}.
The newly allocated block is suitably aligned for any type of variable,
and is not guaranteed to be zeroed.

On failure an error code from \code{ompd\_rc\_t} is returned by the callback.

\subsubsection{Context Management and Navigation}

The tool provides the OMPD plugin with callbacks
to manage and navigate context relationships.

\argdesc
This callback maps an operating system thread handle within the address
space identified by \plc{address\_space\_context} to a tool thread context.
The operating system thread is identified by the combination
\plc{kind}, \plc{sizeof\_osthread}, and \plc{osthread} arguments.

On success the tool \plc{thread context} is returned in \plc{*thread\_context}.
The \plc{thread context} is created, and remains owned, by the tool.
The OMPD plugin can assume that the \plc{thread context} is valid for
as long as the tool is holding any references to \plc{thread handles}
that may contain the \plc{thread context}.
The OMPD library can use the \plc{thread context} to access
thread local storage (TLS).

On failure, the callback returns an error code from \code{ompd\_rc\_t}.

\argdesc

This callback finds the tool address space context for the thread
identified by the tool thread context \plc{thread\_context}.
On success, the callbacks returns \code{ompd\_rc\_ok},
and the context in \plc{*address\_space\_context}.
If \plc{thread\_context} refers to a host device thread,
this function returns the context for the host address space.
If \plc{thread\_context} refers to a device thread,
this function returns the device's address space.

On failure, the callback returns an error code from \code{ompd\_rc\_t}.

\subsubsection{Sizes of Primitive Types}

The tool provides the OMPD plugin with callbacks
to discover information about the sizes of the basic primitive types
in an address space.
This information is important to an OMPD plugin because the architecture
or programming model of the OpenMP runtime it is examining may be different
from the its own and that of the tool which loaded it.
On platforms with multiple programming models, an OMPD plugin may need
to be able to handle OpenMP runtimes using different sizes for the
basic types.

\argdesc
The OMPD plugin may want to look up the addresses of symbols in
the OpenMP program in order to locate information it needs to satisfy
requests from the tool.
This callback looks up the symbol \plc{symbol\_name}.
The \plc{thread\_context} is optional for global memory access,
and should be NULL in this case.
If \plc{thread\_context} is not NULL, it gives the thread specific
context for the symbol lookup, for the purpose of calculating thread
local storage~(TLS) addresses.

The \plc{symbol\_name} supplied by the OMPD plugin is used verbatim by
the tool, and in particular, no name mangling, demangling
or other transformations are performed prior to the lookup.

On success, the callback returns \code{ompd\_rc\_ok} and the address
of the symbol in \plc{*symbol\_addr}.
Otherwise, on failure an error code from \code{ompd\_rc\_t} is returned.

\subsubsection{Data Format Conversion}
\label{sec:ompd:data-format-conversion}

The architecuture and/or programming-model of tool and
OMPD plugin may be different from that of the OpenMP program being
examined.
Consequently, the conventions for representing data will differ.
The callback interface includes operations for converting between
the conventions, such as byte order (`endianness'),
used by the tool and OMPD plugin on the
one hand, and the OpenMP program on the other.

Each field points to a function that the OMPD plugin should use
for interacting with the OpenMP program, or getting memory from
the tool.

The \plc{d\_alloc\_memory} and \plc{d\_free\_memory} fields are
pointers to functions the OMPD plugin uses to allocate and release
dynamic memory.

\plc{print\_string} points to a function that prints a string.

The architectures or programming models of the OMPD plugin and
party tool may be different from that of the OpenMP
program being examined.
\plc{sizeof\_prim\_type} points to function that allows
the OMPD plugin to determine the sizes of the basic integer
and pointer types used by the OpenMP program.
Because of the differences in architecture or programming model,
the conventions for representing data in the OMPD plugin and
the OpenMP program may be different.
The \plc{device\_to\_host} field points to a function which translates
data from the conventions used by the OpenMP program to that used
by the tool and OMPD plugin.
The reverse operation is performed by the function pointed
to by the \plc{host\_to\_device} field.

The OMPD plugin may need to access memory in the OpenMP program.
The \plc{symbol\_addr\_lookup} field points to a callback the
OMPD plugin can use to find the address of a global or thread
local storage (TLS) symbol.
The \plc{read\_memory} and \plc{write\_memory} fields are
pointers to functions for reading from, and writing to, global or TLS
memory in the OpenMP program, respectively.

\plc{get\_thread\_context\_for\_osthread} is a pointer to a function
the OMPD plugin can use to obtain a tool context that corresponds to
an operating system id.
\plc{get\_address\_space\_context\_for\_thread} points to a callback
the OMPD plugin can use to get the tool context that `owns' the
thread represented by a tool thread context.
