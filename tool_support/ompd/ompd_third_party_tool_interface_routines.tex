\label{subsec:ompd-api}

\subsubsection{Per OMPD Library Initialization and Finalization}

The OMPD library must be initialized exactly once after it is loaded, 
and finalized exactly once before it is unloaded. Per OpenMP process 
or core file initialization and finalization are also required.

Once loaded, the tool can determine the version of the OMPD API that 
the library supports by calling \code{ompd_get_api_version} (see
\specref{subsubsubsec:ompd_get_api_version}). If the tool supports the 
version that \code{ompd_get_api_version} returns, the tool starts the 
initialization by calling \code{ompd_initialize} (see
\specref{subsubsubsec:ompd_initialize}) using the version of the OMPD API 
that the library supports. If the tool does not support the version that
\code{ompd_get_api_version} returns, it may attempt to call 
\code{ompd_initialize} with a different version.



\subsubsubsection{\hcode{ompd_initialize}}
\label{subsubsubsec:ompd_initialize}

\summary
The \code{ompd_initialize} function initializes the OMPD library.

\format
\begin{cspecific}
\begin{ompSyntax}
ompd_rc_t ompd_initialize(
  ompd_word_t \plc{api_version},
  const ompd_callbacks_t *\plc{callbacks}
);
\end{ompSyntax}
\end{cspecific}

\descr
A tool that uses OMPD calls \code{ompd_initialize} to initialize each OMPD 
library that it loads. More than one library may be present in a thid-party 
tool, such as a debugger, because the tool may control multiple devices, which
may use different runtime systems that require different OMPD libraries. This 
initialization must be performed exactly once before the tool can begin to 
operate on an OpenMP process or core file.

\argdesc
The \plc{api_version} argument is the OMPD API version that the tool requests
to use. The tool may call \code{ompd_get_api_version} to obtain the latest 
version that the OMPD library supports.

The tool provides the OMPD library with a set of callback functions in the 
\plc{callbacks} input argument which enables the OMPD library to allocate and 
to deallocate memory in the tool's address space, to lookup the sizes of basic 
primitive types in the device, to lookup symbols in the device, and to read and 
to write memory in the device.

\subsubsubsection{\hcode{ompd_get_api_version}}
\label{subsubsubsec:ompd_get_api_version}

\summary
The \code{ompd_get_api_version} function returns the OMPD API version.

\format
\begin{cspecific}
\begin{ompSyntax}
ompd_rc_t ompd_get_api_version(ompd_word_t *\plc{version});
\end{ompSyntax}
\end{cspecific}

\descr
The tool may call the \code{ompd_get_api_version} function to obtain the 
latest OMPD API version number of the OMPD library.

\argdesc
The latest version number is returned in to the location to which the 
\plc{version} argument points.

\item \code{ompd_rc_t} type, see \specref{subsubsec:ompd_rc_t}.
\end{itemize}



\subsubsubsection{\hcode{ompd_get_version_string}}
\label{subsubsubsec:ompd_get_version_string}

\summary
The \code{ompd_get_version_string} function returns a descriptive 
string for the OMPD API version.

\format
\begin{cspecific}
\begin{ompSyntax}
ompd_rc_t ompd_get_version_string(const char **\plc{string});
\end{ompSyntax}
\end{cspecific}


\descr
The tool may call this function to obtain a pointer to a descriptive 
version string of the OMPD API  version.

\argdesc
A pointer to a descriptive version string is placed into the location
to which \plc{string} output argument points. The OMPD library owns the string 
that the OMPD library returns; the tool must not modify or release this string.
The string remains valid for as long as the library is loaded. The
\code{ompd_get_version_string} function may be called before 
\code{ompd_initialize} (see \specref{subsubsubsec:ompd_initialize}).
Accordingly, the OMPD library must not use heap or stack memory for the string.

The signatures of \code{ompd_get_api_version} (see
\specref{subsubsubsec:ompd_get_api_version}) and \code{ompd_get_version_string} 
are guaranteed not to change in future versions of the API. In contrast, the 
type definitions and prototypes in the rest of the API do not carry the same 
guarantee. Therefore a tool that uses OMPD should check the version of the API 
of the loaded OMPD library before it calls any other function of the API.

\item \code{ompd_rc_t} type, see \specref{subsubsec:ompd_rc_t}.
\end{itemize}



\subsubsubsection{\hcode{ompd_finalize}}
\label{subsubsubsec:ompd_finalize}

\summary
When the tool is finished with the OMPD library it should call 
\code{ompd_finalize} before it unloads the library.

\format
\begin{cspecific}
\begin{ompSyntax}
ompd_rc_t ompd_finalize(void);
\end{ompSyntax}
\end{cspecific}

\descr
The call to \code{ompd_finalize}is must be the last OMPD call that the tool 
makes before it unloads the library. This call allows the OMPD library to
free any resources that it may be holding.

The OMPD library may implement a \emph{finalizer} section, which executes
as the library is unloaded, and therefore after the call to \code{ompd_finalize}. 
During finalization, the OMPD library may use the callbacks that tool earlier 
provided after the call to \code{ompd_initialize}.

\subsubsection{Per OpenMP Process Initialization and Finalization}



\subsubsubsection{\hcode{ompd_process_initialize}}
\label{subsubsubsec:ompd_process_initialize}
\summary
A tool calls \code{ompd_process_initialize} to obtain an address space 
handle when it initializes a session on a live process or core file.

\format
\begin{cspecific}
\begin{ompSyntax}
ompd_rc_t ompd_process_initialize(
  ompd_address_space_context_t *\plc{context},
  ompd_address_space_handle_t **\plc{handle}
);
\end{ompSyntax}
\end{cspecific}

\descr
A tool calls \code{ompd_process_initialize} to obtain an address space 
handle when it initializes a session on a live process or core file.
On return from \code{ompd_process_initialize}, the tool owns the address
space handle, which it must release with \code{ompd_release_address_space_handle}.
The initiatization function must be called before any OMPD operations
are performed on the OpenMP process. This call allows the OMPD library 
to confirm that it can handle the OpenMP process or core file that the 
\plc{context} identifies. Incompatibility is signaled by a 
return value of \code{ompd_rc_incompatible}. 

\argdesc
The \plc{context} argument is an opaque handle that the tool provides to 
address an address space. On return, the \plc{handle} argument provides 
an opaque handle to the tool for this address space, which the tool must
release when it is no longer needed.

\label{subsubsubsec:ompd_device_initialize}

\summary
A tool calls \code{ompd_device_initialize} to obtain an address space 
handle for a device that has at least one  active target region.

\format
\begin{cspecific}
\begin{ompSyntax}
ompd_rc_t ompd_device_initialize(

  ompd_size_t \plc{sizeof_id},
  void *\plc{id},
  ompd_address_space_handle_t **\plc{device_handle}
);
\end{ompSyntax}
\end{cspecific}

\descr
A tool calls \code{ompd_device_initialize} to obtain an address space 
handle for a device that has at least one  active target region. On return 
from \code{ompd_device_initialize}, the tool owns the address space handle.

\argdesc
The \plc{process_handle} argument is an opaque handle that the tool provides
to reference the address space of the OpenMP process. The \plc{device_context} 
argument is an opaque handle that the tool provides to reference a device 
address space. The \plc{kind}, \plc{sizeof_id}, and \plc{id} arguments represent 
a device identifier. On return the \plc{device_handle} argument provides an 
opaque handle to the tool for this address space.

\subsubsubsection{\hcode{ompd_release_address_space_handle}}
\label{subsubsubsec:ompd_release_address_space_handle}

\summary
A tool calls \code{ompd_release_address_space_handle} to release an address space
handle.

\format
\begin{cspecific}
\begin{ompSyntax}
ompd_rc_t ompd_release_address_space_handle(
  ompd_address_space_handle_t *\plc{handle}
);
\end{ompSyntax}
\end{cspecific}

\descr
When the tool is finished with the OpenMP process address space handle it
should call \code{ompd_release_address_space_handle} to release the handle, 
which allows the OMPD library to release any resources that it has related 
to the address space.

\argdesc
The \plc{handle} argument is an opaque handle for the address space to be released.

\restrictions
The \code{ompd_release_address_space_handle} has the following restriction:

\begin{itemize}
\item An address space context must not be used after the corresponding 
      address space handle is released.
\end{itemize}

\item \code{ompd_rc_t} type, see \specref{subsubsec:ompd_rc_t}.
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Thread and Signal Safety}

The OMPD library does not need to be reentrant. The tool must ensure that only 
one thread enters the OMPD library at a time. The OMPD library must not install 
signal handlers or otherwise interfere with the tool's signal configuration.



\subsubsection{Address Space Information}

\subsubsubsection{\hcode{ompd_get_omp_version}}
\label{subsubsubsec:ompd_get_omp_version}

\summary
The tool may call the \code{ompd_get_omp_version} function to obtain the version 
of the OpenMP API that is associated with an address space.

\format
\begin{cspecific}
\begin{ompSyntax}
ompd_rc_t ompd_get_omp_version(
  ompd_address_space_handle_t *\plc{address_space},
  ompd_word_t *\plc{omp_version}
);
\end{ompSyntax}
\end{cspecific}

\descr
The tool may call the \code{ompd_get_omp_version} function to obtain the 
version of the OpenMP API that is associated with the address space.

\argdesc
The \plc{address_space} argument is an opaque handle that the tool provides
to reference the address space of the OpenMP process or device.

Upon return, the \plc{omp_version} argument contains the version of the OpenMP 
runtime in the \code{_OPENMP} version macro format.

\end{ompSyntax}
\end{cspecific}

\descr
After initialization, the tool may call the \code{ompd_get_omp_version_string} 
function to obtain the version of the OpenMP API that is associated with an 
address space.

\argdesc
The \plc{address_space} argument is an opaque handle that the tool provides
to reference the address space of the OpenMP process or device. A pointer to 
a descriptive version string is placed into the location to which the 
\plc{string} output argument points. After returning from the call, the tool 
owns the string. The OMPD library must use the memory allocation callback that 
the tool provides to allocate the string storage. The tool is responsible 
for releasing the memory.

\subsubsection{Thread Handles}



\subsubsubsection{\hcode{ompd_get_thread_in_parallel}}
\label{subsubsubsec:ompd_get_thread_in_parallel}

\summary
The  \code{ompd_get_thread_in_parallel} function enables a tool to obtain 
handles for OpenMP threads that are associated with a parallel region.

\format
\begin{cspecific}
\begin{ompSyntax}

);
\end{ompSyntax}
\end{cspecific}


\descr
A successful invocation of  \code{ompd_get_thread_in_parallel} returns a 
pointer to a thread handle in the location to which \code{thread_handle}
points. This call yields  meaningful results only if all OpenMP threads 
in the parallel region are stopped.

\argdesc
The \plc{parallel_handle} argument is an opaque handle for a parallel region
and selects the parallel region on which to operate. The \plc{thread_num} 
argument selects the thread of the team to be returned. On return, the 
\plc{thread_handle} argument is an opaque handle for the selected thread.

\restrictions
The \code{ompd_get_thread_in_parallel} function has the following restriction:

\begin{itemize}
\item The value of \plc{thread_num} must be a non-negative integer smaller 
      than the team size that was provided as the \plc{ompd-team-size-var} 
      from \code{ompd_get_icv_from_scope}.

\label{subsubsubsec:ompd_get_thread_handle}

\summary
The \code{ompd_get_thread_handle} function maps a native thread 
to an OMPD thread handle.

\format

  const void *\plc{thread_id},
  ompd_thread_handle_t **\plc{thread_handle}
);
\end{ompSyntax}
\end{cspecific}

\descr
The \code{ompd_get_thread_handle} function determines if a native thread 
that the native thread identifier to which  \plc{thread_id} points represents 
an OpenMP thread. If so, the function returns \code{ompd_rc_ok} and the 
locatoin to which \plc{thread_handle} points is set to the thread handle 
for the OpenMP thread.

\argdesc
The \plc{handle} argument is an opaque handle that the tool provides
to reference an address space. The \plc{kind}, \plc{sizeof_thread_id}, 
and \plc{thread_id} arguments represent a native thread identifier.
On return, the \plc{thread_handle} argument provides an opaque handle 
to the thread within the provided address space.

The native thread identifier to which \plc{thread_id} points is guaranteed 
to be valid  for the duration of the call. If the OMPD library must retain 
the native thread identifier, it must copy it.

\descr
Thread handles are opaque to tools, which therefore cannot release them 
directly. Instead, when the tool is finished with a thread handle it must 
pass it to \code{ompd_release_thread_handle} for disposal.

\argdesc
The \plc{thread_handle} argument is an opaque handle for a thread to be released.

\summary
The \code{ompd_thread_handle_compare} function allows tools to compare
two thread handles.

);
\end{ompSyntax}
\end{cspecific}

\descr
The internal structure of thread handles is opaque to a tool. While the 
tool can easily compare pointers to thread handles, it cannot determine 
whether handles of two different addresses refer to the same underlying 
thread. The \code{ompd_thread_handle_compare} function compares thread handles.

On success, \code{ompd_thread_handle_compare} returns in the location to 
which \plc{cmp_value} points a signed integer value that indicates how the 
underlying threads compare: a value less than, equal to, or greater than 0 
indicates that the thread corresponding to \plc{thread_handle_1} is, respectively,
less than, equal to, or greater than that corresponding to \plc{thread_handle_2}.

\argdesc
The \plc{thread_handle_1} and \plc{thread_handle_2} arguments are opaque 
handles for threads. On return the \plc{cmp_value} argument is set to a 
signed integer value.

\descr
The  \code{ompd_get_current_parallel_handle} function enables the tool 
to obtain a pointer to the parallel handle for the current parallel region 
that is associated with an OpenMP thread. This call is meaningful only if 
the associated thread is stopped. The parallel handle must be released by 
calling \code{ompd_release_parallel_handle}.

\descr
The  \code{ompd_get_enclosing_parallel_handle} function enables a tool 
to obtain a pointer to the parallel handle for the parallel region that
encloses the parallel region that \code{parallel_handle} specifies. This 
call is meaningful only if at least one thread in the parallel region 
is stopped. A pointer to the parallel handle for the enclosing region

The \code{ompd_parallel_handle_compare} function compares two parallel 
region handles.

\format
\begin{cspecific}
\begin{ompSyntax}
ompd_rc_t ompd_parallel_handle_compare(
  ompd_parallel_handle_t *\plc{parallel_handle_1},
  ompd_parallel_handle_t *\plc{parallel_handle_2},
  int *\plc{cmp_value}
);
\end{ompSyntax}
\end{cspecific}

\descr
The internal structure of parallel region handles is opaque to tools. While 
tools can easily compare pointers to parallel region handles, they cannot 
determine whether handles at two different addresses refer to the same 
underlying parallel region and, instead must use the 
\code{ompd_parallel_handle_compare} function.

On success, \code{ompd_parallel_handle_compare} returns a signed integer value 
in the location to which \plc{cmp_value} points that indicates how the underlying 
parallel regions compare. A value less than, equal to, or greater than 0 indicates
that the region corresponding to \plc{parallel_handle_1} is, respectively, less 
than, equal to, or greater than that corresponding to \plc{parallel_handle_2}.

For OMPD libraries that always have a single, unique, underlying parallel region handle for
a given parallel region, this operation reduces to a simple comparison of the pointers. However,
other implementations may take a different approach, and therefore the only reliable way of
determining whether two different pointers to parallel regions handles refer the same or distinct
parallel regions is to use \code{ompd_parallel_handle_compare}.

Allowing parallel region handles to be compared allows the tool to hold them in ordered
collections. The means by which parallel region handles are ordered is implementation-defined.

\argdesc

The input arguments \plc{parallel_handle_1} and \plc{parallel_handle_2} are opaque handles
corresponding to parallel regions.
On return the output argument \plc{cmp_value}  returns a signed
integer value that indicates how the underlying parallel regions compare.

%The OMPD API includes operations to obtain the handle of the parent of a task

%
%The generating and scheduling parents need not be the same. This might happen if the

\descr
An OpenMP implementation may support only a subset of the states defined by
the \code{omp_states_t} enumeration type. In addition, an
OpenMP implementation may support implementation-specific states.
The \code{ompd_enumerate_states} call enables a tool to
enumerate the thread states supported by an OpenMP implementation.

When the \plc{current_state} input argument is set to a 
thread state supported by an OpenMP implementation,
the call will assign the value and string name of the next thread state in the enumeration
to the locations pointed to by the 
\plc{next_state} and \plc{next_state_name} output arguments, respectively.

After returning from the call, the string \plc{next_state_name} is `owned' by the 
third-party tool.
The string storage must be allocated by the OMPD library using the memory allocation 
callback provided by the tool.
The tool is responsible for releasing the memory.

Whenever one or more states are left in the enumeration,
the call will set the location pointed to by the \plc{more_enums} 
output argument to $1$.
When the last state in the enumeration is passed in \plc{current_state}, 
the call will set the location pointed to by the \plc{more_enums} output
argument to $0$.


\argdesc

The address space is identified by the input argument \plc{address_space_handle}.

The input argument \plc{current_state} must be a thread state
supported by the OpenMP implementation.  To begin enumerating the
states that an OpenMP implementation supports, a tool should pass
\code{omp_state_undefined} as the value of the input argument \plc{current_state}.  Subsequent
calls to \code{ompd_enumerate_states} by the tool should pass the
value returned by the call in the \plc{next_state} output argument.

The output argument \plc{next_state} is a pointer to an integer where
the call will return the value of the next state in the
enumeration.

The output argument \plc{next_state_name} is a pointer to a
character string pointer, where the call will return a string
describing the next state.

The output argument \plc{more_enums} is a pointer to an integer where
the call will return a value of $1$ when there are more states left to enumerate
or a value of $0$ when there are not.

\constraints
Any string returned through the argument
\plc{next_state_name} must be immutable and defined

\descr
The function \code{ompd_get_display_control_vars} returns a
NULL-terminated vector of strings of name/value pairs of control
variables whose settings are (a) user controllable,
and (b) important to the operation or performance of an OpenMP
runtime system.
The control variables exposed through this interface include all
of the OpenMP environment variables, settings that may come from
vendor or platform-specific environment variables, and other
settings that affect the operation or functioning of an OpenMP
runtime.

The format of the strings is:
\begin{center}
\code{name=a string}
\end{center}

The third-party tool must not modify the vector or the strings
(i.e., they are both \code{const}).
The strings are NULL terminated.
The vector is NULL terminated.

After returning from the call, the vector and strings are `owned'
by the third third-party tool.
Providing the termination constraints are satisfied, the OMPD library
is free to use static or dynamic memory for the
vector and/or the strings, and to arrange them in memory
as it pleases.
If dynamic memory is used, then the OMPD library must use
the allocate callback it received in the call to \code{ompd_initialize}.
As the third-party tool cannot make any assumptions about the origin or
layout of the memory used for the vector or strings, it cannot release
the display control variables directly when they are no longer
needed; instead it must use \code{ompd_release_display_control_vars()}.

\argdesc
The address space is identified by the input argument \plc{address_space_handle}.
The vector of display control variables is returned through
the output argument \plc{control_vars}.

The vector and strings returned from \code{ompd_get_display_control_vars}

Because the third-party tool doesn't know how the memory for the vector
and strings was alloacted, it cannot deallocate the memory itself.

\subsubsubsection{\hcode{ompd_enumerate_icvs}}
\label{subsubsubsec:ompd_enumerate_icvs}

\summary
Enumerate ICVs supported by an OpenMP implementation.

\format
\begin{cspecific}
\begin{ompSyntax}
ompd_rc_t ompd_enumerate_icvs (
  ompd_address_space_handle *\plc{handle}, 
  ompd_icv_id_t \plc{current},
  ompd_icv_id_t *\plc{next_id},
  const char **\plc{next_icv_name},
  ompd_scope_t *\plc{next_scope},
  int *\plc{more}
);
\end{ompSyntax}
\end{cspecific}

\descr
In addition to the ICVs listed in Table~\ref{tab:ICV Initial Values}, an OpenMP 
implementation must support the OMPD specific ICVs listed in Table~\ref{tab:OMPD internal varibales} in 
the OMPD interface.
An OpenMP implementation might support additional implementation specific variables.

Also an implementation might decide to store ICVs in a different scope than suggested in 
Table~\ref{tab:Scopes of ICVs}.
The \code{ompd_enumerate_icvs} call enables a tool to enumerate the ICVs supported by an 
OpenMP implementation and the related scopes.

When the \plc{current} input argument is set to a value supported by an OpenMP 
implementation,
the call will assign the value, string name, and scope of the next ICV in the enumeration
to the locations pointed to by the 
\plc{next_id}, \plc{next_icv_name}, and \plc{next_scope} output arguments, respectively.

After returning from the call, the string \plc{next_icv_name} is `owned' by the 
third-party tool.
The string storage must be allocated by the OMPD library using the memory allocation 
callback provided by the tool.
The tool is responsible for releasing the memory.


Whenever one or more ICV are left in the enumeration,
the call will set the location pointed to by the \plc{more} 
output argument to $1$.
When the last ICV in the enumeration is passed in \plc{current}, 
the call will set the location pointed to by the \plc{more} output
argument to $0$


\argdesc

The address space is identified by the input argument \plc{address_space_handle}.

The input argument \plc{current} must be an ICV supported by the OpenMP implementation.  
To begin enumerating the ICVs that an OpenMP implementation supports, a tool should pass
\code{ompd_icv_undefined} as the value of the input argument \plc{current}.  
Subsequent calls to \code{ompd_enumerate_icvs} by the tool should pass the
value returned by the call in the \plc{next_id} output argument.

The output argument \plc{next_id} is a pointer to an integer where
the call will return the id of the next ICV in the
enumeration.

The output argument \plc{next_icv} is a pointer to a
character string pointer, where the call will return a string
providing the name of the next ICV.

The output argument \plc{next_scope} is a pointer to a
scope enum value, where the call will return the scope for the next ICV.

The output argument \plc{more_enums} is a pointer to an integer where
the call will return a value of $1$ when there are more ICV left to enumerate
or a value of $0$ when there are not.

\constraints
Any string returned through the argument
\plc{next_icv} must be immutable and defined
for the lifetime of a program execution.
