\ompdsubsection{Per OMPD Library Initialization}

The OMPD library must be initialized exactly once after it is loaded, and finalized exactly once
before it is unloaded. Per OpenMP process or core file initialization and finalization are also required. 
A tool starts the initialization by calling \code{ompd\_initialize}. Once loaded, the 
debugger can determine the version of the OMPD API supported by the plugin by 
calling \code{ompd\_get\_version}:

\format
\vbox{
\cspecificstart
\begin{boxedcode}
ompd_rc_t ompd_get_version(int *\plc{version});
\end{boxedcode}
\cspecificend
}

On success this should return \code{ompd\_rc\_ok}; \code{ompd\_rc\_bad\_input} indicates that the 
argument is invalid. Other errors could be reported by \code{ompd\_rc\_error}. A descriptive string 
describing the OMPD library is returned by the function \code{ompd\_get\_version\_string}:

\format
\vbox{
\cspecificstart
\begin{boxedcode}
ompd_rc_t ompd_get_version_string(const char **\plc{string});
\end{boxedcode}
\cspecificend
}

The return values are the same as \code{ompd\_get\_version\_string}. The string returned by the 
OMPD library is `owned' by the library, and it must not be modified or released by the tool.
It is guaranteed to remain valid for as long as the library is loaded. 
\code{ompd\_get\_version\_string} 
may be called before \code{ompd\_initialize}. Accordingly, the OMPD library must not use heap or 
stack memory for the string it returns to the tool.

The signatures of \code{ompd\_get\_version} and \code{ompd\_get\_version\_string} are 
guaranteed not to change in future versions of the API. In contrast, the type definitions and 
prototypes in the rest of the API do not carry the same guarantee. Therefore an OMPD using tool 
should check the version of the API of a loaded OMPD library before calling any other function of 
the API.

The tool must provide the OMPD library with a set of callback functions 
that enable OMPD to allocate and deallocate memory in the tool's address space, to lookup the 
sizes of basic primitive types in the device, to lookup symbols in the device, as well as to read and 
write memory in the device. These callback functions are provided to the OMPD library via a 
table---a list of function pointers---of type \code{ompd\_callbacks\_t}.

\format
\vbox{
\cspecificstart
\begin{boxedcode}
ompd_rc_t ompd_initialize(const ompd_callbacks_t *\plc{callbacks});
\end{boxedcode}
\cspecificend
}

On success, \code{ompd\_initialize} returns \code{ompd\_rc\_ok}. If the \code{data} argument is 
invalid, \code{ompd\_rc\_bad\_input} should be returned. All other errors will be reported by 
\code{ompd\_rc\_error}.

The above initialization is performed for each OMPD library that is loaded by an OMPD using tool. 
There may be more than one library present in a thid-party tool, such as a debugger, because the tool 
may be controlling a number of devices that may be using different runtime systems which require 
different OMPD libraries. This initialization must be performed exactly once before the tool
can begin operating on a OpenMP process or core file.

\begin{comment}
\ompdsubsection{Per OpenMP Process Initialization}

An OMPD tool initializes a session working on an OpenMP process or core
file by calling \code{ompd\_process\_initialize}:

\format
\vbox{
\cspecificstart
\begin{boxedcode}
ompd_rc_t ompd_process_initialize(
  ompd_address_space_context_t  *\plc{context},
  ompd_address_space_handle_t  **\plc{handle}
);
\end{boxedcode}
	\cspecificend
}

The \code{context} argument is a pointer to the tool's context object for the address space
of the OpenMP process or core file.  The OMPD library 
returns a pointer to the address space handle in \code{*handle}, which the tool is responsible for 
releasing when it is no longer needed. This function must be called before any OMPD operations 
are performed on the OpenMP process.

\code{ompd\_process\_initialize} gives the OMPD library an opportunity to confirm that it is capable 
of handling the OpenMP process or core file identified by the \code{context}. Incompatibility is signaled by a 
return value of \code{ompd\_rc\_incompatible}. On return, the handle is owned by the tool, 
which must release it using \code{ompd\_release\_address\_space\_handle}.

\ompdsubsection{Per OpenMP Process Finalization}

When the tool is finished working on the OpenMP process address space for a process or core file, it calls
\code{ompd\_release\_address\_space\_handle}
to tell the OMPD library that it no longer needs the address space
and give the OMPD library an opportunity to release any
resources it may have related to the handle.
\end{comment}

\ompdsubsection{Per OMPD Library Finalization}

When the tool is finished with the OMPD library it should call \code{ompd\_finalize} before 
unloading the library.

\format
\vbox{
\cspecificstart
\begin{boxedcode}
ompd_rc_t ompd_finalize(void);
\end{boxedcode}
\cspecificend
}

This must be the last call the tool makes to the library before
unloading it. The call to \code{ompd\_finalize} gives the OMPD library a chance to
free up any remaining resources it may be holding.

The OMPD library may implement a \emph{finalizer} section. This will execute as the library is 
unloaded, and therefore after the tool's call to \code{ompd\_finalize}. The OMPD library is allowed 
to use the callbacks (provided to it earlier by the tool after the call to 
\code{ompd\_initialize}) during finalization.

	\specref{sec:ompd_address_space_handle_t}.
\end{itemize}

\ompdsubsection{Memory Management}

The OMPD library must not access the heap manager directly. Instead, if it needs heap memory it 
must use the memory allocation and deallocation callback functions provided by the tool 
to obtain and release heap memory. This will ensure that the library does not interfere with any 
custom memory management scheme that the tool may use.

If the OMPD library is implemented in \code{C++}, memory management operators like \code{new} 
and \code{delete} in all their variants, \emph{must all} be overloaded and implemented in terms of 
the callbacks provided by the tool. The OMPD library must be coded so that any of its 
definitions of \code{new} or \code{delete} do not interfere with any defined by the tool.

In some cases, the OMPD library will need to allocate memory to return results to the
tool. This memory will then be `owned' by the tool, which will be responsible for releasing it. It is 
therefore vital that the OMPD library and the tool use the same memory manager.

OMPD handles are created by the OMPD library. These are opaque to the 
tool, and depending on the specific implementation of OMPD may have complex 
internal structure. The tool cannot know whether the handle pointers returned by the API 
correspond to discrete heap allocations. Consequently, the tool must not simply deallocate a 
handle by passing an address it receives from the OMPD library to its own memory manager. 
Instead, the API includes functions that the tool must use when it no longer needs a handle.

Contexts are created by a tool and passed to the OMPD library. The OMPD 
library does not need to release contexts; instead this will be done by the tool after it releases any 
handles that may be referencing the contexts.

\ompdsubsection{Thread and Signal Safety}

The OMPD library does not need to be reentrant. It is the responsibility 
of the tool to ensure that only one thread enters the OMPD library at a time. The OMPD 
implementation must not install signal handlers or otherwise interfere with the tool's signal 
configuration.

The \code{ompd\_thread\_handle\_compare} operation allows tools to compare 
two thread handles.

\descr
The internal structure of thread handles is opaque to a tool. While the tool can easily compare 
pointers to thread handles, it cannot determine whether handles of two different addresses
refer to the same underlying thread. This function can be used to compare thread handles.

On success, \code{ompd\_thread\_handle\_compare} returns in \code{*cmp\_value} a signed 
integer value that indicates how the underlying threads compare: a value less than, equal to, or 
greater than 0 indicates that the thread corresponding to \code{thread\_handle\_1} is, respectively, 
less than, equal to, or greater than that corresponding to \code{thread\_handle\_2}.

%\begin{notes}
%	ilaguna: do we need to give intuition about what we mean by thread1 < thread2 
%	(or vice versa)? Will the OMPD DLL maintain a total order or a partial order of 
%	thread handles? If thread1 < thread2, and thread2 < thread3, is thread1 < 
%	thread3 or can thread1 > thread3?
%\end{notes}

% JP: rationale, so dropped
%For OMPD libraries that always have a single, unique, underlying thread handle for a given 
%thread, this operation reduces to a simple comparison of the pointers. However, other 
%implementations may take a different approach, and therefore the only reliable way of determining 
%whether two different pointers to thread handles refer the same or distinct threads is to use
%\code{ompd\_thread\_handle\_compare}.
%
%Allowing thread handles to be compared allows the tool to hold them in ordered collections.
%The means by which thread handles are ordered is implementation-defined.

compare pointers to parallel region handles, it cannot determine whether handles at two different 
addresses refer to the same underlying parallel region.

On success, \code{ompd\_parallel\_handle\_compare} returns in \code{*cmp\_value} a signed 
integer value that indicates how the underlying parallel regions compare: a value less than, equal 
to, or greater than 0 indicates that the region corresponding to \code{parallel\_handle\_1} is,
respectively, less than, equal to, or greater than that corresponding to \code{parallel\_handle\_2}.

For OMPD libraries that always have a single, unique, underlying parallel region handle for 
a given parallel region, this operation reduces to a simple comparison of the pointers. However, 
other implementations may take a different approach, and therefore the only reliable way of 
determining whether two different pointers to parallel regions handles refer the same or distinct
parallel regions is to use \code{ompd\_parallel\_handle\_compare}.

Allowing parallel region handles to be compared allows the debugger to hold them in ordered 
collections. The means by which parallel region handles are ordered is implementation-defined.

\argdesc

The input arguments \plc{parallel\_handle\_1} and \plc{parallel\_handle\_2} are opaque handles 
corresponding to parallel regions.
On return the output argument \plc{cmp\_value}  returns a signed 
integer value that indicates how the underlying parallel regions compare.

\littleheader{Retrieve the handle for an enclosing task.}
The OMPD API includes operations to obtain the handle of the parent of a task represented by a 
given task handle. There are two notions of parenthood. The \emph{scheduling} parent task is the 
task that was active when the child task was scheduled to run. The \emph{generating} is the task 
that encountered the OpenMP that caused the child task to be created.

The generating and scheduling parents need not be the same. This might happen if the thread 
executing a task encounters an OpenMP construct. When this happens, the thread will enter the 
runtime. The runtime will set up the tasks to implement the OpenMP program construct, and then 
call its schedular to choose a task to execute. If the scheduler chooses a task other than one of 
these newly created tasks to run, the scheduling parent of the selected task will not be the same 
as its generating parent. The former is the task that the thread was executing most recently,
and from which it entered the runtime. The later is the task which encountered the OpenMP 
construct it is executing.

This call is meaningful only if all threads associated with the parallel region are stopped.
The OMPD library must use the memory allocation callback to obtain the memory for the vector of

heap memory for the task handles it returns, it must use the callbacks to acquire this memory.
After the call the vector and the task handles are `owned' by the tool, which is responsible for 
deallocating them. The task handles must be released calling \code{ompd\_release\_task\_handle}.
The vector was allocated by the OMPD library using the
allocation routine passed to it during the call to \code{ompd\_initialize}.
The tool itself must deallocate the vector in a compatible manner.

\descr
OMPD provides the function \code{ompd\_get\_thread\_handle}
to inquire whether an operating system thread is an OpenMP
thread or not.
If the function returns \code{ompd\_rc\_ok}, then the operating
system thread is an OpenMP thread and \code{*thread\_handle}
will be initialized to a pointer to the thread handle for
the OpenMP thread.

\argdesc


The input argument \plc{handle} is an opaque handle provided by the debugger
to reference to an address space.
The input arguments \plc{kind},  \plc{sizeof\_osthread}, and \plc{osthread} represent an operating 
system thread identifier. 
On return the output argument \plc{thread\_handle} provides an opaque handle to the
tool for thread within the provided address space.

The operating system ID \plc{*osthread} is guaranteed to be valid for the duration of the call. If the 
OMPD library needs to retain the operating system-specific thread identifier it must copy it.

%\The thread handle \plc{*thread\_handle} returned by the OMP implementation
%is `owned' by the debugger, which must release it by calling
%\code{ompd\_release\_thread\_handle}.
%If \plc{os\_thread} does not refer to an OpenMP thread,
%\code{ompd\_get\_thread\_handle} returns \code{ompd\_rc\_bad\_input}
%and \plc{*thread\_handle} is also set to NULL.

\descr
\code{ompd\_get\_osthread} performs the mapping between an OMPD
thread handle and an operating system-specific thread identifier.

\argdesc

The input argument \plc{thread\_handle} is an opaque thread handle.
The output arguments \plc{kind},  \plc{sizeof\_osthread}, and \plc{osthread} represent an operating 
system thread identifier.

%The caller indicates what \plc{kind} of operating system-specific thread
%identifier it wants by setting the \plc{kind}
%`in' parameter.
%It also passes a pointer to the buffer into which the OMPD
%implementation writes the operating system-specific thread identifier,
%and the size of the buffer, to the OMPD library.
%The buffer is owned by the debugger.

%On success \code{ompd\_get\_osthread} returns \code{rc\_ok},
%and returns the operating system-specific thread identifier in
%\plc{*osthread}.
%If the operation fails, the OMPD library returns
%the appropriate value from \code{ompd\_rc\_t}.
%Note that the operation should fail if the OMPD library is
%unable to return an operating system-specific identifier of the
%requested `kind' or size.

is that the OMPD version must supply a thread handle to provide
a context for this inquiry.

\argdesc
The states are represented by values of the enumeration type
\code{ompd\_state\_t}.
The symbolic names of the members of \code{ompd\_state\_t} should
match those of the OMPT enumeration type \code{omp\_state\_e}.
However, there is no guarantee that the numeric values of the corresponding
symbolic constants are identical.

ompd\_rc\_t ompd\_get\_display\_control\_vars (

);
\end{boxedcode}
\cspecificend

\descr
The function \code{ompd\_get\_display\_control\_vars} returns a
NULL-terminated vactor of strings of name/value pairs of control
variables whose settings are (a) user controllable,
and (b) importannt to the operation or performance of an OpenMP
runtime system.
The control variables exposed through this interface include all
of the OpenMP environment variables, settings that may come from
vendor or platform-specific environment variables, and other
settings that affect the operation or functioning of an OpenMP
runtime.

The format of the strings is:
\begin{center}
\code{name=a string}
\end{center}

The third-party tool must not modify the vector or the strings
(i.e., they are both \code{const}).
The strings are NULL terminated.
The vector is NULL terminated.

After returning from the call, the vector and strings are `owned'
by the third third-party tool.
Providing the termination constraints are satisfied, the OMPD
implementation is free to use static or dynamic memory for the
vector and/or the strings, and to arrange them in memory
as it pleases.
If dynamic memory is used, then the OMPD implementation must use
the allocate callback it received in the call to \code{ompd\_initialize}.
As the third-party tool cannot make any assumptions about the origin or
layout of the memory used for the vector or strings, it cannot release
the display control variables directly when they are no longer
needed; instead it must use \code{ompd\_release\_display\_control\_vars~()}.

\argdesc
The address space is identified by the input argument \plc{address\_space\_handle}.
The vector of display control variables is return through
the output argument \plc{control\_vars}.

\descr
The vector and strings returned from \code{ompd\_get\_display\_control\_vars}
are `owned' by the thrid-party, but allocated by the OMPD.
Because the third-party tool doesn't know how the memory for the vector
and strings was alloacted, it cannot deallocate the memory itself.
Instead, the third-party tool must call
\code{ompd\_release\_display\_control\_vars} to release the vector
and strings.

\argdesc
The input parameter \plc{control\_vars} is the vector of display control variables to be released.
