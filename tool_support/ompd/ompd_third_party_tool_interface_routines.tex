\label{sec:ompd-api}

\ompdsubsection{Per OMPD Library Initialization}

The OMPD library must be initialized exactly once after it is loaded, and finalized exactly once
before it is unloaded. Per target process or core file initialization and finalization are also required. 
A third-party tool starts the initialization by calling \code{ompd\_initialize}. Once loaded, the 
debugger can determine the version of the OMPD API supported by the plugin by 
calling \code{ompd\_get\_version}:

\format
\vbox{
\ccppspecificstart
\begin{boxedcode}
ompd_rc_t ompd_get_version(int *\plc{version});
\end{boxedcode}
\ccppspecificend
}

On success this should return \code{ompd\_rc\_ok}; \code{ompd\_rc\_bad\_input} indicates that the 
argument is invalid. Other errors could be reported by \code{ompd\_rc\_error}. A descriptive string 
describing the OMPD implementation is returned by the function \code{ompd\_get\_version\_string}:

\format
\vbox{
\ccppspecificstart
\begin{boxedcode}
ompd_rc_t ompd_get_version_string(const char **\plc{string});
\end{boxedcode}
\ccppspecificend
}

The return values are the same as \code{ompd\_get\_version\_string}. The string returned by the 
OMPD library is `owned' by the library, and it must not be modified or released by the tool.
It is guaranteed to remain valid for as long as the library is loaded. 
\code{ompd\_get\_version\_string} 
may be called before \code{ompd\_initialize}. Accordingly, the OMPD library must not use heap or 
stack memory for the string it returns to the tool.

The signatures of \code{ompd\_get\_version} and \code{ompd\_get\_version\_string} are 
guaranteed not to change in future versions of the API. In contrast, the type definitions and 
prototypes in the rest of the API do not carry the same guarantee. Therefore a third-party tool 
should check the version of the API of a loaded OMPD library before calling any other function of 
the API.

The third-party tool must provide the OMPD library with a set of callback functions 
that enable OMPD to allocate and deallocate memory in the tool's address space, to lookup the 
sizes of basic primitive types in the target, to lookup symbols in the target, as well as to read and 
write memory in the target. These callback functions are provided to the OMPD library via a 
table---a list of function pointers---of type \code{ompd\_callbacks\_t}.

\format
\vbox{
\ccppspecificstart
\begin{boxedcode}
ompd_rc_t ompd_initialize(const ompd_callbacks_t *\plc{callbacks});
\end{boxedcode}
\ccppspecificend
}

%The type \refdef{\texttt{ompd\_callbacks\_t}}{callbacks-t:def} is defined in
%Section~\ref{sec:ompd_data_types}. The argument is guaranteed to be valid for the duration of 
%the call.
%The OMPD library cannot assume that \texttt{callbacks} will remain valid
%after the call returns back to the debugger.
%\begin{notes}
%ilaguna: We need to be more specific here. What does the previous sentence 
%mean?	
%\end{notes}

On success, \code{ompd\_initialize} returns \code{ompd\_rc\_ok}. If the \code{data} argument is 
invalid, \code{ompd\_rc\_bad\_input} should be returned. All other errors will be reported by 
\code{ompd\_rc\_error}.

The above initialization is performed for each OMPD library that is loaded by a third-party tool. 
There may more than one library present in a thid-party tool, such as a debugger, because the tool 
may be controlling a number of targets that may be using different runtime systems which require 
different OMPD libraries. This initialization must be performed exactly once before the tool
can begin operating on a target process or core file.

\ompdsubsection{Per Target Initialization}

A third-party tool initializes a session working on a target process or core
file by calling \code{ompd\_process\_initialize}:

\format
\vbox{
\ccppspecificstart
\begin{boxedcode}
ompd_rc_t ompd_process_initialize(
  ompd_address_space_context_t  *\plc{context},   /* IN */
  ompd_address_space_handle_t  **\plc{handle}   /* OUT */
);
\end{boxedcode}
	\ccppspecificend
}

The \code{context} argument is the pointer to the third-party tool's host
address space context object for the target process or core file. The OMPD implementation 
returns a pointer to the address space handle in \code{*handle}, which the tool is responsible for 
releasing when it is no longer needed. This function must be called before any OMPD operations 
are performed on the target.
\code{ompd\_process\_initialize} gives the OMPD library an opportunity to confirm that it is capable 
of handling the target process or core file identified by the context. Incompatibility is signaled by a 
return value of \code{ompd\_rc\_incompatible}. On return, the handle is owned by the tool, 
which must release it using \code{ompd\_release\_address\_space\_handle}.

\ompdsubsection{Per Target Finalization}

When the tool is finished working on the target address space for a process or core file, it calls
\code{ompd\_release\_address\_space\_handle}
to tell the OMPD implementation that it no longer needs the address space
and give the OMPD implementation an opportunity to release any
resources it may have related to the handle.

\ompdsubsection{Per OMPD Library Finalization}

When the tool is finished with the OMPD library it should call \code{ompd\_finalize} before 
unloading the library.

\format
\vbox{
\ccppspecificstart
\begin{boxedcode}
ompd_rc_t ompd_finalize(void);
\end{boxedcode}
\ccppspecificend
}

This must be the last call the tool makes to the library before
unloading it. The call to \code{ompd\_finalize} gives the OMPD library a chance to
free up any remaining resources it may be holding.

The OMPD library may implement a \emph{finalizer} section. This will execute as the library is 
unloaded, and therefore after the tool's call to \code{ompd\_finalize}. The OMPD library is allowed 
to use the callbacks (provided to it earlier by the third-party tool after the call to 
\code{ompd\_initialize}) during finalization.

\ompdsubsection{Memory Management}

The OMPD library must not access the heap manager directly. Instead, if it needs heap memory it 
must use the memory allocation and deallocation callback functions provided by the third-party tool 
to obtain and release heap memory. This will ensure that the library does not interfere with any 
custom memory management scheme that the tool may use.

If the OMPD library is implemented in \code{C++}, memory management operators like \code{new} 
and \code{delete} in all their variants, \emph{must all} be overloaded and implemented in terms of 
the callbacks provided by the third-party tool. The OMPD library must be coded so that any of its 
definitions of \code{new} or \code{delete} do not interfere with any defined by the tool.

In some cases, the OMPD library will need to allocate memory to return results to the third-party 
tool. This memory will then be `owned' by the tool, which will be responsible for releasing it. It is 
therefore vital that the OMPD library and the tool use the same memory manager.

OMPD handles are created by the OMPD implementation. These are opaque to the 
third-party tool, and depending on the specific implementation of OMPD may have complex 
internal structure. The tool cannot know whether the handle pointers returned by the API 
correspond to discrete heap allocations. Consequently, the tool must not simply deallocate a 
handle by passing an address it receives from the OMPD library to its own memory manager. 
Instead, the API includes functions that the tool must use when it no longer needs a handle.

Contexts are created by a third-party tool and passed to the OMPD implementation. The OMPD 
library does not need to release contexts; instead this will be done by the tool after it releases any 
handles that may be referencing the contexts.

\ompdsubsection{Thread and Signal Safety}

The OMPD implementation does not need to be reentrant. It is the responsibility 
of the third-party tool to ensure that only one thread enters the OMPD library at a time. The OMPD 
implementation must not install signal handlers or otherwise interfere with the tool's signal 
configuration.

\ompdsubsection{Thread Handles}

\ompdcallbacksignature{\code{ompd\_get\_threads}}
\summary
The \code{ompd\_get\_threads} enables a tool to
to obtain pointers to handles for all OpenMP threads associated
with an address space handle.

\format
\vbox{
\ccppspecificstart
\begin{boxedcode}
ompd_rc_t ompd_get_threads(
  ompd_address_space_handle_t *\plc{handle},   /* IN */
  ompd_thread_handle_t ***\plc{thread_handle_vector},   /* OUT */
  int *\plc{num_handles}   /* OUT */
);
\end{boxedcode}
\ccppspecificend
}

\descr
A successful invocation of  \code{|ompd\_get\_threads} returns
a pointer to a vector of pointers to handles in \code{*thread\_handle\_vector}
and returns the number of handle pointers in \code{*num\_handles}.
This call yields meaningful results only if all OpenMP threads in
the target process are stopped; otherwise, the OpenMP runtime may be creating and/or destroying
threads during or after the call, rendering useless the
vector of handles returned.

The \code{num\_handles} pointer argument must be valid.
The \code{thread\_handle\_vector} pointer argument may be NULL,
in which case the number of handles that would have been returned
had the argument not been NULL is returned in \code{*num\_handles}.
This allows the debugger to find out how many OpenMP threads are
running in the address space when it is not interested in the handles 
themselves.

The OMPD library gets the memory required for the vector of pointers to thread 
handles using the memory allocation routine in the callbacks it received during
the call to \code{ompd\_initialize}. If the OMPD implementation needs to allocate heap memory for 
the thread handles, it must use the callbacks to acquire this memory. On return, the vector and the 
thread handles are `owned' by the debugger, and the debugger is responsible for releasing them 
when they are no longer required.

The thread handles must be released by calling 
\code{ompd\_release\_thread\_handle}. The vector was allocated by the OMPD implementation 
using the allocation routine in the callbacks it received during initialization 
%(see \refdef{\code{ompt\_initialize}}{initialize:def}); 
the debugger must deallocate the vector in a 
compatible manner.

\end{boxedcode}

}

\descr
The internal structure of thread handles is opaque to a tool. While the tool can easily compare 
pointers to thread handles, it cannot determine whether handles of two different addresses
refer to the same underlying thread. This function can be used to compare thread handles.

On success, \code{ompd\_thread\_handle\_compare} returns in \code{*cmp\_value} a signed 
integer value that indicates how the underlying threads compare: a value less than, equal to, or 
greater than 0 indicates that the thread corresponding to \code{thread\_handle\_1} is, respectively, 
less than, equal to, or greater than that corresponding to \code{thread\_handle\_2}.

%\begin{notes}
%	ilaguna: do we need to give intuition about what we mean by thread1 < thread2 
%	(or vice versa)? Will the OMPD DLL maintain a total order or a partial order of 
%	thread handles? If thread1 < thread2, and thread2 < thread3, is thread1 < 
%	thread3 or can thread1 > thread3?
%\end{notes}

For OMPD implementations that always have a single, unique, underlying thread handle for a given 
thread, this operation reduces to a simple comparison of the pointers. However, other 
implementations may take a different approach, and therefore the only reliable way of determining 
whether two different pointers to thread handles refer the same or distinct threads is to use
\code{ompd\_thread\_handle\_compare}.

Allowing thread handles to be compared allows the tool to hold them in ordered collections.
The means by which thread handles are ordered is implementation-defined.

\littleheader{Retrieve the handle for an enclosing task.}
The OMPD API includes operations to obtain the handle of the parent of a task represented by a 
given task handle. There are two notions of parenthood. The \emph{scheduling} parent task is the 
task that was active when the child task was scheduled to run. The \emph{generating} is the task 
that encountered the OpenMP that caused the child task to be created.

The generating and scheduling parents need not be the same. This might happen if the thread 
executing a task encounters an OpenMP construct. When this happens, the thread will enter the 
runtime. The runtime will set up the tasks to implement the OpenMP program construct, and then 
call its schedular to choose a task to execute. If the scheduler chooses a task other than one of 
these newly created tasks to run, the scheduling parent of the selected task will not be the same 
as its generating parent. The former is the task that the thread was executing most recently,
and from which it entered the runtime. The later is the task which encountered the OpenMP 
construct it is executing.

A third-party tool uses \code{ompd\_get\_generating\_ancestor\_task\_region} to obtain

\descr
This call is meaningful only if all threads associated with the parallel region are stopped.
The OMPD library must use the memory allocation callback to obtain the memory for the vector of 
pointers to task handles returned by the operation. If the OMPD implementation needs to allocate 
heap memory for the task handles it returns, it must use the callbacks to acquire this memory.
After the call the vector and the task handles are `owned' by the tool, which is responsible for 
deallocating them. The task handles must be released calling \code{ompd\_release\_task\_handle}.
The vector was allocated by the OMPD implementation using the
allocation routine passed to it during the call to \code{ompd\_initialize}.
The tool itself must deallocate the vector in a compatible manner.

The \code{ompd\_task\_handle\_compare} operations allows a third-party tool to compare task 
handles.

  int *\plc{cmp_value}   /* OUT */
);
\end{boxedcode}
\ccppspecificend
}

\descr
The internal structure of task handles is opaque to the tool. While the tool can easily compare 
pointers to task handles, it cannot determine whether handles at two different addresses refer
to the same underlying task.

On success, \code{ompd\_task\_handle\_compare} returns in \code{*cmp\_value} a signed integer 
value that indicates how the underlying tasks compare: a value less than, equal to, or greater than 
0 indicates that the task corresponding to \plc{task\_handle\_1} is, respectively, less than, equal 
to, or greater than that corresponding to \plc{task\_handle\_2}.

For OMPD implementations that always have a single, unique, underlying task handle for a given 
task, this operation reduces to a simple comparison of the pointers. However, other 
implementations may take a different approach, and therefore the only reliable way of determining 
whether two different pointers to task handles refer the same or distinct task is to use 
\code{ompd\_task\_handle\_compare}.

Allowing task handles to be compared allows the tool to hold them in ordered collections.
The means by which task handles are ordered is implementation-defined.

owned by the tool, which is responsible for deallocating it.

The contents of the strings returned for task handles which compare as equal with
\code{ompd\_task\_handle\_compare} must be the same.

%\begin{notes}
%	JVD: This section needs careful review by the OpenMP Tools Working
%	Group to ensure its correctness.  It depends on whether or not John
%	Mellor-Crummey's 07/16/15 email proposal to omp-tools@openmp.org to
%	change the semantics of the \code{reenter\_runtime\_addr} field is
%	adopted.  What we decide, OMPD and OMPT should be consistent.
%\end{notes}
%
%The \code{ompd\_get\_task\_frame} function returns stack frame
%information about the target thread associated with the task.
%%
%This routine corresponds to \code{ompt\_get\_task\_frame} in the OMPT
%API, and the approach for stack inspection is similar to that
%described in Appendix~B of~\cite{ompt-tr2}.
%%
%The \code{exit\_runtime\_addr} gives the address of the frame at which
%the thread \emph{left} the OpenMP runtime to execute the user code
%associated with the task.
%%
%The \code{reenter\_runtime\_addr} is the address of the frame that
%called the OpenMP runtime.
%\begin{notes}
%	JVD: Follows John Mellor-Crummey's
%	07/16/15 email proposal to omp-tools@openmp.org to change the
%	semantics of the \code{reenter\_runtime\_addr} field.)
%\end{notes}
%%
%The debugger can unwind a thread's stack by getting the
%thread's current task using
%\refdef{\code{ompd\_get\_top\_task\_region}}{get-top-task-region:def}.
%\begin{notes}
%	JVD: This assumes that the thread is ``bound'' to the task
%	handle. Is that correct?
%\end{notes}
%%
%Using the task handle, the debugger can find the thread's exit and
%reentry stack frame addresses using \code{ompd\_get\_task\_frame}.
%%
%It can then use \refdef{\code{ompd\_get\_scheduling\_ancestor\_task\_region}}{get-scheduling-ancestor-task-region:def} to find the next task in the
%thread's stack, and then call \code{ompd\_get\_task\_frame} for the parent task.
%%
%The frames between the scheduling parent task's reenter address and the top
%task's exit address are frames in which the thread is executing OpenMP
%runtime code.
%\begin{notes}
%	JVD: Is this still accurate given John M-C's
%	proposed new semantics? I think with the new semantics, the addresses
%	are always for user frames, not OpenMP runtime frames, so ``between''
%	means \emph{exclusive} of the frame addresses.
%\end{notes}
%%
%This process can be repeated to allow all frames in the thread's
%backtrace that correspond to execution in the OpenMP runtime to be
%identified.
%
%Using the generating ancestor operation \refdef{\code{ompd\_get\_generating\_ancestor\_task\_region}}{get-generating-ancestor-task-region:def},
%the same process can be used to determine the chain logical ancestors.
%Note that in this case the logical backtrace may traverse
%across the stacks of different threads.
%
%The position within the stack frame where the runtime addresses point
%is implementation defined.

\descr
OMPD provides the function \code{ompd\_get\_thread\_handle}
to inquire whether an operating system thread is an OpenMP
thread or not.
If the function returns \code{ompd\_rc\_ok}, then the operating
system thread is an OpenMP thread and \code{*thread\_handle}
will be initialized to a pointer to the thread handle for
the OpenMP thread.

\argdesc

The operating system ID \plc{*osthread} is guaranteed
to be valid for the duration of the call.
If the OMPD implementation needs to retain the operating system-specific
thread identifier it must copy it.

The thread handle \plc{*thread\_handle} returned by the OMP implementation
is `owned' by the debugger, which must release it by calling
\code{ompd\_release\_thread\_handle}.
If \plc{os\_thread} does not refer to an OpenMP thread,
\code{ompd\_get\_thread\_handle} returns \code{ompd\_rc\_bad\_input}
and \plc{*thread\_handle} is also set to NULL.

\descr
\code{ompd\_get\_osthread} performs the mapping between an OMPD
thread handle and an operating system-specific thread identifier.

\argdesc
The caller indicates what \plc{kind} of operating system-specific thread
identifier it wants by setting the \plc{kind}
`in' parameter.
It also passes a pointer to the buffer into which the OMPD
implementation writes the operating system-specific thread identifier,
and the size of the buffer, to the OMPD implementation.
The buffer is owned by the debugger.

On success \code{ompd\_get\_osthread} returns \code{rc\_ok},
and returns the operating system-specific thread identifier in
\plc{*osthread}.
If the operation fails, the OMPD implementation returns
the appropriate value from \code{ompd\_rc\_t}.
Note that the operation should fail if the OMPD implementation is
unable to return an operating system-specific identifier of the
requested `kind' or size.

\descr
The function \code{ompd\_get\_state} is a  third-party version of
\code{ompt\_get\_state}. 
The only difference between the OMPD and OMPT counterparts
is that the OMPD version must supply a thread handle to provide
a context for this inquiry.
% Calls to this function need not return meaningful results unless the thread 
%is stopped.

\argdesc
The states are represented by values of the enumeration type
\code{ompd\_state\_t}.
The symbolic names of the members of \code{ompd\_state\_t} should
match those of the OMPT enumeration type \code{omp\_state\_e}.
However, there is no guarantee that the numeric values of the corresponding
symbolic constants are identical.
