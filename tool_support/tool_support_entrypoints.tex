\section{Runtime Entry Points for Tools}
\label{sec:entry-points}

The OMPT interface supports two principal sets of runtime entry points for tools. One
set of runtime entry points enables a tool to register callbacks for OpenMP
events and to inspect the state of an OpenMP thread while
executing in a tool callback or a signal handler. The second set of runtime entry points enables a
tool to trace activities on a device. When directed by the tracing
interface, an OpenMP implementation will trace activities on a device, collect
buffers full of trace records, and invoke callbacks on the host to
process these records.
Runtime entry points for tools in an OpenMP implementation
should not be global symbols since tools cannot rely on the visibility
of such symbols in general.

In addition, the OMPT interface supports
runtime entry points for two classes of lookup routines. The first
class of lookup routines contains a single member: a
routine that returns runtime entry points in the OMPT callback interface.
The second class of lookup routines includes
a unique lookup routine for each kind of
device that can return runtime entry points in a device's OMPT tracing interface.

\subsection{Entry Points in the OMPT Callback Interface}
\label{sec:ompt-callback-entry-points}

Entry points in the OMPT callback interface enable a tool to register
callbacks for OpenMP events and to inspect the state of an OpenMP thread while
executing in a tool callback or a signal handler.
A tool obtains pointers to these runtime entry points
using the lookup function passed to the tool's initializer for the
callback interface.

\omptruntimeentrypoint{\code{ompt\_enumerate\_states\_t}}

\label{sec:ompt_enumerate_states}

\summary
A runtime entry point known as \code{ompt\_enumerate\_states}
with type signature \code{ompt\_enumerate\_states\_t}
enumerates the thread states supported by an OpenMP
implementation.

\format

\vbox{
\begin{ccppspecific}

typedef int (*ompt_enumerate_states_t)(
  int \plc{current_state},
  int *\plc{next_state},

\end{boxedcode}
\end{ccppspecific}
}

\descr
An OpenMP implementation may support only a subset of the states defined by
the \code{omp\_states\_t} enumeration type. In addition, an
OpenMP implementation may support implementation-specific states.
The \code{ompt\_enumerate\_states} runtime entry point enables a tool to
enumerate the thread states supported by an OpenMP implementation.

When a thread state supported by an OpenMP implementation is passed
as the first argument to the runtime entry point,
the runtime entry point will assign the next thread state in the enumeration to
the variable passed by reference as the runtime entry point's second argument
and assign the name associated with the next thread state
to the character pointer passed by reference as the third argument.

Whenever one or more states are left in the enumeration,
the enumerate states runtime entry point will return $1$.
When the last state in the enumeration is passed
as the first argument, the runtime entry point will return $0$
indicating that the enumeration is complete.



\argdesc

The \callbackarg{} \plc{current\_state} must be a thread state
supported by the OpenMP implementation.  To begin enumerating the
states that an OpenMP implementation supports, a tool should pass
\code{omp\_state\_undefined} as \plc{current\_state}.  Subsequent
invocations of the runtime entry point by the tool should pass the
value assigned to the variable passed by reference as the second
argument to the previous call.

The \callbackarg{} \plc{next\_state} is a pointer to an integer where
the entry point will return the value of the next state in the
enumeration.

The \callbackarg{} \plc{next\_state\_name} is a pointer to a
character string pointer, where the entry point will return a string
describing the next state.

\constraints
Any string returned through the \callbackarg{}
\plc{next\_state\_name} must be immutable and defined
for the lifetime of a program execution.

\begin{note}
The following example illustrates how a tool can
enumerate all states supported by an OpenMP implementation.
The example assumes that a function pointer to enumerate

A runtime entry point known as \code{ompt\_enumerate\_mutex\_impls}

}

\descr
An OpenMP implementation may implement mutual exclusion for locks,
nest locks, critical sections, and atomic regions in several different
ways.  The \code{ompt\_enumerate\_mutex\_impls} runtime entry point
enables a tool to enumerate the
kinds of mutual exclusion implementations that an OpenMP implementation
employs.
The value \code{ompt\_mutex\_impl\_unknown} is reserved to indicate an invalid
implementation.



When a mutex kind supported by an OpenMP implementation is passed
as the first argument to the runtime entry point,
the runtime entry point will assign the next mutex kind in the enumeration to
the variable passed by reference as the runtime entry point's second argument
and assign the name associated with the next mutex kind
to the character pointer passed by reference as the third argument.

Whenever one or more mutex kinds are left in the enumeration,
the runtime entry point to enumerate mutex implementations will return $1$.
When the last mutex kind in the enumeration is passed
as the first argument, the runtime entry point will return $0$
indicating that the enumeration is complete.

\argdesc

The \callbackarg{} \plc{current\_impl} must be a mutex implementation
kind supported by an OpenMP implementation.  To begin enumerating the
mutex implementation kinds that an OpenMP implementation supports, a
tool should pass \code{ompt\_mutex\_impl\_unknown} as the first
argument of the enumerate mutex kinds runtime entry point.  Subsequent
invocations of the runtime entry point by the tool should pass the
value assigned to the variable passed by reference as the second
argument to the previous call.

The \callbackarg{} \plc{next\_impl} is a pointer to an integer where
the entry point will return the value of the next mutex implementation
in the enumeration.

The \callbackarg{} \plc{next\_impl\_name} is a pointer to a character
string pointer, where the entry point will return a string describing
the next mutex implementation.

\omptruntimeentrypoint{\code{ompt\_set\_callback\_t}}

\label{sec:ompt_set_callback}

\summary

A runtime entry point known as \code{ompt\_set\_callback}
with type signature \code{ompt\_set\_callback\_t} registers a
pointer to a tool callback that an OpenMP implementation will invoke when a host
OpenMP event occurs.

\format
\vbox{
\begin{ccppspecific}
\begin{boxedcode}
typedef int (*ompt_set_callback_t)(
  ompt_callbacks_t \plc{which},
  ompt_callback_t \plc{callback}
);
\end{boxedcode}
\end{ccppspecific}
}

\descr

OpenMP implementations can inform tools about events that occur during
the execution of an OpenMP program using callbacks.
To register a tool callback for an OpenMP event on the current device,
a tool uses the runtime entry point
known as \code{ompt\_set\_callback}
with type signature \code{ompt\_set\_callback\_t}.

The return value of the \code{ompt\_set\_callback} runtime entry point may indicate several possible
outcomes. Callback registration may fail if it is called outside the initializer for the
callback interface, returning \code{omp\_set\_error}.
Otherwise, the return value of \code{ompt\_set\_callback}
indicates whether \emph{dispatching} a callback leads to its invocation.
A return value of \code{ompt\_set\_never} indicates that the callback
will never be invoked at runtime.
A return value of \code{ompt\_set\_sometimes} indicates that the callback
will be invoked at runtime for an implementation-defined subset of
associated event occurrences.
A return value of \code{ompt\_set\_sometimes\_paired} is similar to
\code{ompt\_set\_sometimes}, but provides an additional guarantee for
callbacks with an \plc{endpoint} parameter. Namely, it guarantees that a callback
with an \plc{endpoint} value of \code{ompt\_scope\_begin} is invoked if and only if
the same callback with \plc{endpoint} value of \code{ompt\_scope\_end} will
also be invoked sometime in the future.
A return value of \code{ompt\_set\_always} indicates that the callback
will be always invoked at runtime for associated event occurrences.

\argdesc

The \callbackarg{} \plc{which} indicates the callback being registered.

The \callbackarg{} \plc{callback} is a tool callback function.

A tool may pass a \code{NULL} value for \plc{callback} to disable
any callback associated with \plc{which}. If disabling was successful,
\code{ompt\_set\_always} is returned.

\constraints
When a tool registers a callback for an event, the type
signature for the callback must match the type signature appropriate for the
event.

\descr
During execution, an OpenMP program may employ nested parallel
regions.
To obtain information about a parallel region,
a tool uses the runtime entry point known as
\code{ompt\_get\_parallel\_info}
with type signature \code{ompt\_get\_parallel\_info\_t}.
This runtime entry point
can be used to obtain information about the current parallel region,
if any, and any enclosing parallel regions
for the current execution context.

The entry point returns 2 if there is a parallel region at the
specified ancestor level and the information is available,
1 if there is a parallel region at the specified ancestor level
but the information is currently unavailable, and 0 otherwise.

A tool may use the pointer to a parallel region's data object that it
obtains from this runtime entry point to inspect or modify the value
of the data object.  When a parallel region is created, its data
object will be initialized with the value \code{ompt\_data\_none}.

This runtime entry point is \emph{async signal safe}.

\argdesc

The \callbackarg{} \plc{ancestor\_level} specifies the parallel region
of interest to a tool by its ancestor level.  Ancestor level 0 refers
to the innermost parallel region; information about enclosing parallel
regions may be obtained using larger ancestor levels.

If a parallel region exists at the specified ancestor level
and the information is currently available,
information will be returned in the variables \plc{parallel\_data} and
\plc{team\_size} passed by reference to the entry point.
Specifically, a reference to the parallel region's associated data
object will be assigned to *\plc{parallel\_data} and the number of
threads in the parallel region's team will be assigned to
*\plc{team\_size}.

If no enclosing parallel region exists at the specified ancestor
level, or the information is currently unavailable,
the values of variables passed by reference
*\plc{parallel\_data} and *\plc{team\_size} will be undefined when the
entry point returns.

\constraints
While \callbackarg{} \plc{ancestor\_level} is passed by
value, all other arguments to the entry point must be references
to variables of the specified types.


\restrictions
Between a \emph{parallel-begin} event and an \emph{implicit-task-begin}
event, a call to \code{ompt\_get\_parallel\_info(0,...)} may return
information about the outer parallel team, the new parallel team or an
inconsistent state.

If a thread is in the state \code{omp\_state\_wait\_barrier\_implicit\_parallel},
a call to \code{ompt\_get\_parallel\_info}
may return a pointer to a copy of the specified parallel region's \plc{parallel\_data}
rather than a pointer to the data word for the region itself. This convention enables the master thread
for a parallel region to free storage for the region immediately after the region ends, yet
avoid having some other thread in the region's team
potentially reference the region's \plc{parallel\_data} object after it has been freed.

\summary
A runtime entry point known as \code{ompt\_get\_task\_info}

context.

\descr
During execution, an OpenMP thread may be executing an OpenMP task.
Additionally, the thread's stack may contain
procedure frames associated with suspended OpenMP tasks or
OpenMP runtime system routines.
To obtain information about any task on the current thread's stack,
a tool uses the runtime entry point known as
\code{ompt\_get\_task\_info}
with type signature \code{ompt\_get\_task\_info\_t}.

Ancestor level 0 refers to the active task; information about
other tasks with associated frames present on the stack in the current execution context may be queried at
higher ancestor levels.

The \code{ompt\_get\_task\_info} runtime entry point
returns 2 if there is a task region at the
specified ancestor level
and the information is available, 1 if there is a task region at the
specified ancestor level but the information is currently unavailable,
and 0 otherwise.

If a task exists at the specified ancestor level and the information is available,
information will be returned in the variables passed by reference to the entry
point.  If no task region exists at the specified ancestor level
or the information is unavailable,
the values of variables passed by reference to the entry point will be
undefined when the entry point returns.

A tool may use a pointer to a data object for a task or parallel
region that it obtains from this runtime entry point to inspect or modify the
value of the data object.  When either a parallel region or a task
region is created, its data object will be initialized with the value
\code{ompt\_data\_none}.

This runtime entry point is \emph{async signal safe}.

\argdesc

The \callbackarg{} \plc{ancestor\_level} specifies the task region
of interest to a tool by its ancestor level.  Ancestor level 0 refers
to the active task; information about
ancestor tasks found in the current execution context may be queried at
higher ancestor levels.

The \callbackarg{} \plc{type} is pointer to a task type return
value or a \code{NULL} if no task type return value is required.

The \callbackarg{} \plc{task\_data} is a pointer to a task data
pointer return value
or a \code{NULL} if no task data pointer return value is required.


The \callbackarg{} \plc{task\_frame} is a pointer to a task frame
pointer return value
or a \code{NULL} if no task frame pointer return value is required.

The \callbackarg{} \plc{parallel\_data} is a pointer to a parallel
data pointer return value
or a \code{NULL} if no parallel data pointer return value is required.

The \callbackarg{} \plc{thread\_num} is a pointer to a return value
for a thread number
or a \code{NULL} if no thread number return value is required.

\effect


If the runtime entry point returns 0 or 1, no return values will be set.
Otherwise, the entry point has the effects described below.

If a non-\code{NULL} value was passed for \plc{type},
the value returned in *\plc{type} represents the type of the task
at the specified level.
Task types that a tool may observe on a thread's stack include
initial, implicit, explicit, and target tasks.

If a non-\code{NULL} value was passed for \plc{task\_data},
the value returned in *\plc{task\_data} is a pointer to a data word
associated with the task at the specified level.

If a non-\code{NULL} value was passed for \plc{task\_frame},
the value returned in *\plc{task\_frame} is a pointer to the
\code{ompt\_frame\_t} structure associated with the task at the specified level.
Appendix~\ref{chap:frames} discusses an example that
illustrates the use of \code{ompt\_frame\_t} structures with multiple
threads and nested parallelism.

If a non-\code{NULL} value was passed for \plc{parallel\_data},
the value returned in *\plc{parallel\_data} is a pointer to a data word
associated with the parallel region containing the task at the specified level.
If the task at the specified level is an initial task,
the value of *\plc{parallel\_data} will be \code{NULL}.

If a non-\code{NULL} value was passed for \plc{thread\_num},
the value returned in *\plc{thread\_num}
indicates the number of the thread in the parallel region executing the task.

\label{sec:ompt_get_record_ompt_t}

\summary
A runtime entry point for a device known as \code{ompt\_get\_record\_ompt}
with type signature \code{ompt\_get\_record\_ompt\_t}
obtains a pointer to an OMPT trace record from a trace buffer associated with a device.

\format
\vbox{\begin{ccppspecific}
\begin{boxedcode}
typedef ompt_record_ompt_t *(*ompt_get_record_ompt_t)(
  ompt_buffer_t *\plc{buffer},
  ompt_buffer_cursor_t \plc{current}
);
\end{boxedcode}
\end{ccppspecific}}

\descr

This function returns a pointer that may point to a record in the
trace buffer, or it may point to a record in thread local storage
where the information extracted from a record was assembled. The
information available for an event depends upon its type.

The return value of type \code{ompt\_record\_ompt\_t}
defines a union type that can represent
information for any OMPT event record type.
Another call to the runtime entry point may overwrite the
contents of the fields in a record returned by a prior invocation.

\argdesc
The \callbackarg{} \plc{buffer} indicates a trace buffer.

The \callbackarg{} \plc{current} is an opaque buffer cursor.

\label{sec:ompt_get_record_native_t}

\summary

A runtime entry point for a device known as
\code{ompt\_get\_record\_native} with type signature
\code{ompt\_get\_record\_native\_t}
obtains a pointer to a native trace record from a trace buffer associated with a device.

\format
\vbox{\begin{ccppspecific}
\begin{boxedcode}
typedef void *(*ompt_get_record_native_t)(
  ompt_buffer_t *\plc{buffer},
  ompt_buffer_cursor_t \plc{current},
  ompt_id_t *\plc{host_op_id}
);
\end{boxedcode}
\end{ccppspecific}}

\descr

The pointer returned  may point into the specified trace buffer, or into
thread local storage where the information extracted from a trace
record was assembled. The information available for a native event
depends upon its type. If the function returns a non-NULL result,
it will also set \code{*host\_op\_id} to identify host-side identifier
for the operation associated with the record.  A subsequent call
to \code{ompt\_get\_record\_native} may overwrite the
contents of the fields in a record returned by a prior invocation.

\argdesc
The \callbackarg{} \plc{buffer} indicates a trace buffer.

The \callbackarg{} \plc{current} is an opaque buffer cursor.

The \callbackarg{} \plc{host\_op\_id} is a pointer to an identifier
that will be returned by the function. The entry point will set
*\plc{host\_op\_id} to the value of a host-side identifier for an operation on
a target device that was created when the operation was initiated by
the host.

\summary
A runtime entry point for a device known as
\code{ompt\_get\_record\_abstract}
with type signature
\code{ompt\_get\_record\_abstract\_t}
summarizes the context of a native (device-specific) trace record.

\format
\vbox{\begin{ccppspecific}
\begin{boxedcode}
typedef ompt_record_abstract_t *
(*ompt_get_record_abstract_t)(
  void *\plc{native_record}
);
\end{boxedcode}
\end{ccppspecific}}

\descr
An OpenMP implementation may execute on a device that logs
trace records in a native (device-specific) format unknown to a tool.
A tool can use the \code{ompt\_get\_record\_abstract}
runtime entry point for the device with type signature
\code{ompt\_get\_record\_abstract\_t}
to decode a native trace record that it
does not understand into a standard form that it can interpret.

\argdesc

The \callbackarg{} \plc{native\_record} is a pointer to a native trace
record.

\subsection{Lookup Entry Point}

\omptruntimeentrypoint{\code{ompt\_function\_lookup\_t}}
\label{sec:ompt_function_lookup_t}
\label{sec:ompt_function_lookup}

\summary
A tool uses a lookup routine with type signature
\code{ompt\_function\_lookup\_t}
to obtain pointers to runtime entry points that are
part of the OMPT interface.

\format
\vbox{
\begin{ccppspecific}
\begin{boxedcode}
typedef ompt_interface_fn_t (*ompt_function_lookup_t) (
  const char *\plc{interface_function_name}
);
\end{boxedcode}
\end{ccppspecific}
}

\descr

An OpenMP implementation provides a pointer to a lookup routine as an
argument to tool callbacks used to initialize tool support for
monitoring an OpenMP device using either tracing or callbacks.



When an OpenMP implementation invokes a tool initializer to configure
the OMPT callback interface, the OpenMP implementation will pass the
initializer a lookup function that the tool can use to obtain
pointers to runtime entry points that implement routines that are part of
the OMPT callback interface.

When an OpenMP implementation invokes a tool initializer to configure
the OMPT tracing interface for a device, the Open implementation will
pass the device tracing initializer a lookup function that the tool
can use to obtain pointers to runtime entry points that implement
tracing control routines appropriate for that device.

A tool can call the lookup function to obtain a pointer to a runtime
entry point.

\argdesc
The \callbackarg{} \plc{interface\_function\_name} is a C string
that represents the name of a runtime entry point.
