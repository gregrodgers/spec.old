\summary
The \code{ompt_wait_id_t} type describes wait identifier for an OpenMP thread.

\format
\begin{ccppspecific}
\begin{omptOther}
typedef uint64_t ompt_wait_id_t;
\end{omptOther}

\descr

Each thread instance maintains a \emph{wait identifier} of type 
\code{ompt_wait_id_t}. When a task executing on a thread is waiting 
for mutual exclusion, the thread's wait identifier indicates what the 
thread is awaiting. A wait identifier may represent a critical section 
{\em name}, a lock, a program variable accessed in an atomic region, or 
a synchronization object internal to an OpenMP implementation.

\code{ompt_wait_id_none} is defined as an instance of type 
\code{ompt_wait_id_t} with the value 0.

When a thread is not in a wait state, the value of the thread's wait 
identifier is undefined.
