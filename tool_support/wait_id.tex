\index{wait identifier}

\summary
The \code{ompt_wait_id_t} type describes wait identifiers for an OpenMP thread.

\format
\begin{ccppspecific}
\begin{omptOther}
typedef uint64_t ompt_wait_id_t;
\end{omptOther}
\end{ccppspecific}

\descr
Each thread instance maintains a \emph{wait identifier} of type 
\code{ompt_wait_id_t}. When a task that a thread executes is waiting 
for mutual exclusion, the wait identifier of the thread indicates the 
reason that the thread is waiting. A wait identifier may represent a 
critical section {\em name}, a lock, a program variable accessed in an 
atomic region, or a synchronization object that is internal to an 
OpenMP implementation.

\code{ompt_wait_id_none} is defined as an instance of type 
\code{ompt_wait_id_t} with the value 0.

When a thread is not in a wait state, the value of the wait identifier 
of the thread is undefined.
